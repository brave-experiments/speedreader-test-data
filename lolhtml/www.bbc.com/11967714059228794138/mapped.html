The team did not set a pole position in any of the remaining two races in Brazil and Abu Dhabi either.</p><p>Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto said the two matters were not related, and that apparent differences in the car's straight-line performance seen by rivals following the ruling were <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/50284855">caused by the team changing the way they ran it and adding more downforce and therefore drag.</a></p><h3 class="sp-story-body__cross-head">What will happen now? </h3><p>Rivals objected to the confidential settlement between the FIA and Ferrari aimed at concluding the matter because they were concerned that it did not make it clear whether Ferrari's engine was legal at all times last year or not.</p><p>As a result, they are unlikely to be mollified by the FIA's admission that it was unable to allay its own suspicions or their feeling that they were unable to prove them.</p><p>Teams are likely to see that as an admission by the FIA that it is not capable of policing its own regulations - a highly unsatisfactory position for a competition that is based on fairness and equality of opportunity.</p><p>As such, it is likely that rivals will not accept this latest step from the FIA as a satisfactory conclusion and will seek further explanations.</p><p>However, the FIA and Ferrari are likely to point to the <a class="sp-story-body__external-link" href="https://www.fia.com/international-tribunal">regulations that cover confidential settlements such as this.<i class="sp-story-body__external-link-icon gelicon gelicon--external" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></p><p>These state that immunity granted in this way is subject to a number of conditions, including:</p><ul><li>"Cooperating with the FIA in good faith, meaning telling the whole truth and refraining from destroying, falsifying or concealing useful information or evidence"  </li></ul><ul><li>"Providing the FIA with genuine, total and permanent cooperation throughout the entire investigation", including "testimony in accordance with any request and in any form required by the FIA" and "remaining at the disposal of the FIA to reply swiftly to any questions it may have".  </li></ul>
