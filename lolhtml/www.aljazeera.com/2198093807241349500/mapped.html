<h3>06:55 GMT - Tokyo chief: Cancelling Olympics 'impossible'</h3>
<p><span>Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said cancelling the summer Olympic Games was "impossible", saying Japan was "not thinking of changing directions nor changing plans at all".</span></p>
<p><span>Koike said Tokyo was coordinating and closely discussing with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and organisers "toward holding the games".</span></p>
<p><span>The president of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee said he had received an apology from an executive board member who said the Games should be delayed a year to two because of the coronavirus.</span></p>
<h3>06:15 GMT</h3>
<p>I'll be handling over this blog to my colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/tamila87v" target="_blank">Tamila Varshalomidze</a> in Doha shortly.</p>
<p>Here's a quick summary of this morning's developments:</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump spoke to Americans earlier from the White House, announcing a European travel ban and a series of measures to tackle the virus.Democrats in Congress have also drawn up a bill that they aim to pass later on Thursday to provide sick pay, financial support and other benefits to those affected by the virus.</p>
<p>The NBA has suspended the basketball season, while Oscar-winning Hollywood actor Tom Hanks and his wife, Rita Wilson, have both been hospitalised in Australia with the virus.</p>
<p>In the Philippines, there is growing anxiety within political circles with President Rodrigo Duterte being tested and the parliament sealed off for disinfection after a top transport official was diagnosed with COVID-19. The Asian Development Bank, which has its headquarters in Manila, has also been closed for deep cleaning.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in China, the number of new cases fell to the lowest since the outbreak began.   </p>
<h3>06:10 GMT - Johns Hopkins changes Taiwan designation after outcry</h3>
<p>Johns Hopkins University, has changed the way it refers to Taiwan on a map detailing the spread of the new coronavirus, after the institution began referring to the self-ruled island as part of China prompting objections from the government of the self-ruled island.</p>
<p>Beijing, which claims Taiwan as its own, has been exerting pressure on foreign companies and organisations to identify the territory as part of China, and often to name it as a Chinese province.</p>
<p>Taiwan has objected saying it is an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name, that has never been part of the People's Republic of China.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) lists Taiwan's coronavirus case numbers under China's, referring to the island as "Taipei and environs".</p>
<p>That same designation appeared on the Johns Hopkins interactive <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6">map</a> earlier this week, but has now reverted to calling the island "Taiwan".</p>

<p>The ministry is tracking down the Malaysians who were present and urging them to contact the authorities. Singapore, meanwhile, is looking for 95 people from the city-state who were at the event, the local Straits Times reported.</p>
<p>With the WHO designation of a pandemic, Malaysia is also advising that all mass gatherings and events be postponed.</p>

<p>It will also guarantee free coronavirus testing for anyone who requires it, including those who don't have health insurance.</p>
<h3>04:00 GMT - Japan must plan for Olympic cancellation risk</h3>
<p>Japan must plan for any postponement or cancellation of the Tokyo Olympic Games, even if it seems unlikely, Shigeru Ishiba, a ruling party heavyweight seen as a leading candidate to be the next prime minister told Reuters.</p>
<p>Ishiba, an outspoken critic of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, said on Wednesday the fate of the summer games was a decision best left to the International Olympic Committee (IOC). He declined to comment on what the best move might be.</p>
<p>"Not thinking about worst-case scenarios won't eliminate the risk of them materialising," Ishiba said.</p>
<p>"The government must start thinking now about what to do" in case the Olympics Games is cancelled or postponed, he added.</p>

<p>Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said on Thursday there has been no change to plans for the games, which are supposed to start on July 24.</p>
