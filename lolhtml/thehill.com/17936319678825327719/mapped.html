South Korea reported that the projectiles fired from Sandok, a coastal town, including from a multiple-launch rocket system, flew up to 124 miles and reached 50 km in altitude. The launch took place a week after North Korea launched two short-range missiles following three months of inaction. Today’s decision also took place two days after the North Koreans threatened to take “momentous” action after criticism from five European nations over last week’s launch (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles/north-korea-fires-three-projectiles-into-sea-south-korea-says-idUSKBN20V14H">Reuters</a>). </p><p> </p><p>➔<strong> Royal Family: Prince Harry</strong> and <strong><span class="rollover-people" data-behavior="rolloverpeople"><a class="rollover-people-link" data-nid="446499" href="https://thehill.com/people/meghan-markle">Meghan Markle</a><span class="rollover-people-block" id="rollover-people-446499"></span></span></strong>, the Duchess of Sussex, will take part in their final commitment as working members of the royals when they appear at the annual Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey in London today.
