During the day, I was so tired my knees would buckle. Driving the car, my head would dip and then I would catch myself. My face was lined with exhaustion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At night, I would sleep fitfully, legs churning, then snap awake with a start, gasping for breath, heart racing.</p>
<p>My doctor was puzzled. He ordered blood tests, urine tests, an electrocardiogram &ndash; maybe, he thought, the trouble was heart disease &ndash; those night-time palpitations&hellip;</p>
<p>No, my heart was fine. My blood was fine.</p>
<p>He ordered a colonoscopy. It was late 2008 and I was 47 years old &ndash; almost time to be having one anyway. So I forced down the four litres (seven pints) of Nulytely to wash out my intestines so a gastroenterologist could take a good look inside.</p>
<p>My colon was clean, the doctor told me when I regained consciousness. No cancer. Not even any worrisome polyps.</p>
<p>However, there was one thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While you were under,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you stopped breathing at one point. You might want to check that out. It could be sleep apnoea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had never heard of it.</p>

<p>Sleep is marked by dynamic changes throughout the body. It&rsquo;s made up of different phases, and as you move through them, your breathing, blood pressure and body temperature will all fall and rise. Tension in your muscles mostly stays the same as when you are awake &ndash; except during REM phases, which account for up to a quarter of your sleep. During these, most major muscle groups ease significantly. But if your throat muscles relax too much, your airway collapses and is blocked. The result is obstructive sleep apnoea &ndash; from the Greek &aacute;pnoia, or "breathless".</p>
<p>With sleep apnoea, your air supply is continually interrupted, causing blood oxygen levels to plummet. You then stir, gasping, trying to breathe. This can happen hundreds of times a night, and the ill-effects are many and severe.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__body-native-ad article-body__body-text"><div class=""><div id="bbccom_native_pwa_1_2_3_4" class="bbccom_slot bbccom_standard_slot adslot--native_pwa" aria-hidden="true"><div id="native_pwa" class="bbccom_native_pwa bbccom_advert"></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__pull-quote"><div class="inline-quote"><div class="inline-quote__open-quote"><div class="open-quote gelicon--quote open-quote--large"></div></div><blockquote class="inline-quote__blockquote"><div class="inline-quote__text inline-quote__text--desktop"><h2 class="simple-header simple-header--condensed-bold simple-header--large">A billion people around the world suffer from mild-to-severe sleep apnoea</h2></div></blockquote><div class="inline-quote__social inline-quote__social--desktop"><div class="styled-line styled-line--future"></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__body-text"><div class="body-text-card"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--future body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p>Apnoea puts strain on the heart, as it races to pump blood more quickly to compensate for the lack of oxygen. Fluctuating oxygen levels also cause plaque to build up in the arteries, increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease, hypertension and stroke. In the mid-1990s, the US National Commission on Sleep Disorders Research estimated that 38,000 Americans were dying every year of heart disease worsened by apnoea.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also growing evidence that the condition affects glucose metabolism and promotes insulin resistance &ndash; leading to type 2 diabetes &ndash; and encourages weight gain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the exhaustion of never having a full night&rsquo;s sleep, which is associated with memory loss, anxiety and depression. Lack of sleep also causes inattention that can lead to traffic accidents. A 2015 study of drivers in Sweden found that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25325460">those with sleep apnoea are 2.5 times more likely to have an accident than those without</a>. It also fuels absenteeism, and people with apnoea are fired from their jobs more frequently than those without.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__image-text"><div class="inline-image inline-image--card"><div class="inline-image__image inline-image__image--card"><img draggable="false" title="Man sleeping on bus" srcSet="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/189_106/images/live/p0/85/qt/p085qt8v.jpg 189w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/304_171/images/live/p0/85/qt/p085qt8v.jpg 304w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/85/qt/p085qt8v.jpg 624w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/85/qt/p085qt8v.jpg 976w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/1280_720/images/live/p0/85/qt/p085qt8v.jpg 1280w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/1600_900/images/live/p0/85/qt/p085qt8v.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 70vw, 100vw" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/85/qt/p085qt8v.jpg" alt="Man sleeping on bus" id=""/></div><div class="inline-image__line"><div class="styled-line styled-line--grey styled-line--large"></div></div><div class="inline-image__description inline-image__description--desktop"><div class="text-summary"><p class="text-summary__text text-summary__text--blue text-summary__text--center">Sleep apnoea means you never get a good night’s sleep, putting a strain on your body and mind (Credit: Getty Images)</p></div></div><div class="inline-image__line"><div class="styled-line styled-line--grey styled-line--large"></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__body-text"><div class="body-text-card"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--future body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p>One study found that people with severe sleep apnoea were, all told,<a href="https://aasm.org/study-shows-that-people-with-sleep-apnea-have-a-high-risk-of-death/"> three times as likely</a> to die during an 18-year period as those without.</p>
<p>But, as with smoking during the first decades after it was discovered to be lethal, there&rsquo;s a disconnect between the harm that the condition causes and the public&rsquo;s perception of it as a threat. &ldquo;They fail to link sleep apnoea with its many serious comorbidities,&rdquo; says a report commissioned by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, which <a href="https://aasm.org/resources/pdf/sleep-apnea-economic-crisis.pdf">estimates that it affects 12%</a> <a href="https://aasm.org/resources/pdf/sleep-apnea-economic-crisis.pdf">of US adults</a> &ndash; but 80% go undiagnosed. This prevalence is also found globally: nearly <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lanres/PIIS2213-2600(19)30198-5.pdf">a billion people around the world suffer from mild-to-severe sleep apnoea</a>, according to a 2019 study.</p>
<p>Research is now scrambling to catch up. Medical science has been working overtime to find a solution, from in-depth studies of hypoxia &ndash; how the body reacts to lack of oxygen &ndash; to new types of surgeries and appliances for treating the condition. Of the billion or so people across the globe struggling with sleep apnoea &ndash; most probably not even aware of it, never mind receiving treatment &ndash; I have deep psychological insight into just one: me. As the possibility that I could be facing an under-researched but potentially life-threatening health problem dawned on me, my central concern was simple: how can I fix this?</p>
<p>While there are enduring risk factors for sleep apnoea &ndash; such as obesity, a large neck or large tonsils, a small jaw, or getting older &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t present itself until after an individual falls asleep. The only way to diagnose it is to monitor someone&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>So in early 2009, prompted by both exhaustion and the suggestion from my doctor, I made an appointment at a place called Northshore Sleep Medicine in Northbrook, Illinois.</p>
<p>I was met by Lisa Shives, a specialist in sleep medicine. She peered down my throat, then suggested I take a polysomnogram &ndash; a sleep study, where my breathing, blood oxygen levels, heart rate, and brain and muscle activity would be recorded.</p>
<p>I returned for this a few weeks later, on a Thursday at 9pm.</p>
<p>A technician showed me into a small bedroom containing a double bed and an armoire. Behind the bed, a horizontal window looked into a lab-like room stuffed with equipment. I changed into some flannel sleep pants and called the technician back in. She stuck electrodes over my chest and head, then gave me a fishnet shirt to put on to hold the wires in place.</p>
<p>At about 10pm I clicked off the light and soon fell asleep.</p>
<p>I woke up at 4.30am and fuzzily volunteered to try to go back to sleep, but the technician said they had six hours of data and I was free to go. After I got dressed she told me that my apnoea was &ldquo;severe&rdquo; and that Shives would give me the details later. I had planned to take myself out to a celebratory breakfast, but instead I just went home. I wasn&rsquo;t hungry &ndash; I was scared.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__image-text"><div class="inline-image inline-image--card"><div class="inline-image__image inline-image__image--card"><img draggable="false" title="Woman in sleep monitoring lab" srcSet="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/189_106/images/live/p0/85/qt/p085qtfx.jpg 189w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/304_171/images/live/p0/85/qt/p085qtfx.jpg 304w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/85/qt/p085qtfx.jpg 624w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/85/qt/p085qtfx.jpg 976w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/1280_720/images/live/p0/85/qt/p085qtfx.jpg 1280w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/1600_900/images/live/p0/85/qt/p085qtfx.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 70vw, 100vw" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/85/qt/p085qtfx.jpg" alt="Woman in sleep monitoring lab" id=""/></div><div class="inline-image__line"><div class="styled-line styled-line--grey styled-line--large"></div></div><div class="inline-image__description inline-image__description--desktop"><div class="text-summary"><p class="text-summary__text text-summary__text--blue text-summary__text--center">The only way to diagnose sleep apnoea is to monitor someone’s sleep (Credit: Getty Images)</p></div></div><div class="inline-image__line"><div class="styled-line styled-line--grey styled-line--large"></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__body-text"><div class="body-text-card"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--future body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p>Several weeks later I was back at Northshore, this time during daylight. Shives sat me down in front of a screen full of multi-coloured squiggles and numbers, with a small black-and-white video of me sleeping in the corner. It was unsettling, like seeing a crime scene image of myself, dead.</p>
<p>Speaking of death, I had stopped breathing, Shives told me, for as long as 112 seconds &ndash; almost two minutes.</p>
<p>A normal level of blood oxygen saturation, as measured by a pulse oximeter, is between 95% and 100%. People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease might have a reading in the upper 80s. Mine at times had dipped to 69%.</p>
<p>How bad is that? The World Health Organization, in a surgical guide, suggests that should a patient&rsquo;s blood oxygenation fall to 94% or below, they should immediately be checked to see whether an airway is blocked, a lung has collapsed or there is a problem with their circulation.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__pull-quote"><div class="inline-quote"><div class="inline-quote__open-quote"><div class="open-quote gelicon--quote open-quote--large"></div></div><blockquote class="inline-quote__blockquote"><div class="inline-quote__text inline-quote__text--desktop"><h2 class="simple-header simple-header--condensed-bold simple-header--large">I had stopped breathing for as long as 112 seconds – almost two minutes</h2></div></blockquote><div class="inline-quote__social inline-quote__social--desktop"><div class="styled-line styled-line--future"></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__body-text"><div class="body-text-card"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--future body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p>My options were few. I could, Shives said, have a uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, a procedure as ghastly as its name: removing tissue from my soft palate and widening my airway at the back of my throat. But it would be bloody, and recovery could be long and troublesome. Shives raised the possibility only to immediately dismiss it, which I later suspected was to take the sting off the second option: the mask.</p>
<p>For the first decade and a half after sleep apnoea was identified, there was only one treatment option. You could have a tracheotomy &ndash; a surgical procedure where a hole called a tracheostomy is cut low in your throat to bypass your collapsing upper airway. It offered reliable relief but had significant complications of its own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the early days, doctors didn&rsquo;t know much,&rdquo; says Alan Schwartz, who recently retired as a professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore after years of pioneering exploration on sleep ailments. &ldquo;In the &lsquo;80s, when I began, we were seeing the tip of the iceberg, the most severe apnoea patients. They&rsquo;d wake up with a headache, from their bodies&rsquo; tissues not getting enough oxygen. Feeling very fatigued, as you might expect. They&rsquo;d become depressed, there were mood changes, short temper.&rdquo;</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__image-text"><div class="inline-image inline-image--card"><div class="inline-image__image inline-image__image--card"><img draggable="false" title="People in street" srcSet="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/189_106/images/live/p0/85/qv/p085qvdy.jpg 189w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/304_171/images/live/p0/85/qv/p085qvdy.jpg 304w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/85/qv/p085qvdy.jpg 624w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/85/qv/p085qvdy.jpg 976w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/1280_720/images/live/p0/85/qv/p085qvdy.jpg 1280w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/1600_900/images/live/p0/85/qv/p085qvdy.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 70vw, 100vw" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/85/qv/p085qvdy.jpg" alt="People in street" id=""/></div><div class="inline-image__line"><div class="styled-line styled-line--grey styled-line--large"></div></div><div class="inline-image__description inline-image__description--desktop"><div class="text-summary"><p class="text-summary__text text-summary__text--blue text-summary__text--center">A 2017 study found that sleep apnoea might be present in up to 40% of the general population in Germany (Credit: Getty Images)</p></div></div><div class="inline-image__line"><div class="styled-line styled-line--grey styled-line--large"></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__body-text"><div class="body-text-card"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--future body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p>Despite these woes, patients were understandably wary of having a tracheotomy, which today is<a href="https://www.optecoto.com/article/S1043-1810(15)00082-2/pdf"> &ldquo;a surgical option of last resort&rdquo;</a> performed only in cases of extreme medical urgency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was always a very loud, aggressive snorer, waking up in the middle of the night, gasping,&rdquo; says Angela Cackler of Hot Springs, Arkansas, who was diagnosed with sleep apnoea in 2008, though she believes it began when she was &ldquo;tiny&rdquo;.</p>
<p>By 2012 her heart was failing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went into the emergency room because I was really tired, not feeling well,&rdquo; Angela says. &ldquo;I found out it was heart failure. The next morning, they said, &lsquo;We are going to do a tracheotomy.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And how has she adjusted to the tracheostomy after seven years?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a battle to deal with,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;There is a lot of cleaning. It&rsquo;s nasty. It&rsquo;s work. You don&rsquo;t breathe normally. Your natural humidifier is completely gone. You have to supplement that. You&rsquo;re susceptible to infections.&rdquo; The biggest drawback for her is that it keeps her from swimming, a recreation she once enjoyed. She also hates the looks she gets from people.</p>
<p>That said, the procedure did eliminate her apnoea. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t snore and I can breathe and sleep better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Would she have it done again?</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had to do it again, yeah, absolutely,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It has saved me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though they work in treating sleep apnoea, the life-altering drawbacks of tracheotomies inspired Colin Sullivan, today a professor of medicine at the University of Sydney, to invent the Continuous Positive Airway Pressure machine, or CPAP, that would become the new first-line treatment.</p>
<p>In the late 1970s, he had gone to the University of Toronto to help a sleep researcher investigate respiratory control in dogs during sleep. The research involved delivering experimental gases to dogs through a tracheostomy. Returning to Australia, Sullivan designed a mask that could fit around a dog&rsquo;s snout to deliver the gases that way instead.</p>
<p>A human patient scheduled for a tracheotomy but &ldquo;eager to know if there was anything else that might work&rdquo; &ndash; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100915144130/http:/www.sleepapnea.org/resources/pubs/pioneer.html">Sullivan&rsquo;s words</a> &ndash; inspired him to try to modify the dog mask for use by people.</p>
<p>Sullivan took plaster casts of patients&rsquo; noses, creating a fibreglass mask that tubing could be attached to. The blower was salvaged from a vacuum cleaner, with a head harness crafted from the inside of a bicycle helmet.</p>
<p>In a 1981 paper, he and his colleagues described how, when fitting the mask over the noses of five patients, CPAP <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673681921401">&ldquo;completely prevented the upper airway occlusion&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>Sullivan patented the device, and after a few years of development, he had a version that could be given to people with apnoea for use outside a lab. Today, millions use CPAP machines, though success often requires perseverance.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__image-text"><div class="inline-image inline-image--card"><div class="inline-image__image inline-image__image--card"><img draggable="false" title="Man using CPAP machine" srcSet="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/189_106/images/live/p0/85/qv/p085qvph.jpg 189w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/304_171/images/live/p0/85/qv/p085qvph.jpg 304w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/85/qv/p085qvph.jpg 624w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/85/qv/p085qvph.jpg 976w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/1280_720/images/live/p0/85/qv/p085qvph.jpg 1280w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/1600_900/images/live/p0/85/qv/p085qvph.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 70vw, 100vw" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/85/qv/p085qvph.jpg" alt="Man using CPAP machine" id=""/></div><div class="inline-image__line"><div class="styled-line styled-line--grey styled-line--large"></div></div><div class="inline-image__description inline-image__description--desktop"><div class="text-summary"><p class="text-summary__text text-summary__text--blue text-summary__text--center">CPAP machines are the first-line treatment for sleep apnoea but many sufferers find them frustrating to use (Credit: Getty Images)</p></div></div><div class="inline-image__line"><div class="styled-line styled-line--grey styled-line--large"></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__body-text"><div class="body-text-card"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--future body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p>But as more patients were treated and the CPAP machines&rsquo; technology was refined &ndash; they can now upload data automatically to the cloud for analysis &ndash; doctors made an unwelcome discovery: their primary treatment often didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the late &lsquo;80s, we&rsquo;d sit down with a patient and ask, &lsquo;How&rsquo;s it going with the mask?&rsquo;&rdquo; recalls Schwartz. The patient would report, falsely, how well the mask was working. &ldquo;Until we began to put electronic chips in the machines in the late &lsquo;90s, we never appreciated how little they were using their machines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chips tracked how long the masks were used, and doctors found out they frequently weren&rsquo;t being worn at all. &ldquo;The mask is like something from a bad science fiction movie: big, bulky and obtrusive,&rdquo; <a href="https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/09/treating-sleep-apnea-without-the-mask/">a New York Times article reported in 2012</a>. Studies suggest somewhere between a quarter and half of users abandon their machine within the first year.</p>
<p>I certainly did.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CPAP did make me feel better the first night I wore it &ndash; again under observation at Northshore. I woke refreshed, alert, feeling more energised than I had in years.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__pull-quote"><div class="inline-quote"><div class="inline-quote__open-quote"><div class="open-quote gelicon--quote open-quote--large"></div></div><blockquote class="inline-quote__blockquote"><div class="inline-quote__text inline-quote__text--desktop"><h2 class="simple-header simple-header--condensed-bold simple-header--large">Somewhere between a quarter and half of users abandon their machine within the first year</h2></div></blockquote><div class="inline-quote__social inline-quote__social--desktop"><div class="styled-line styled-line--future"></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__body-text"><div class="body-text-card"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--future body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p>But the positive effect of the mask tapered off considerably after that first deliciously restorative night. Outside of the lab I couldn&rsquo;t reproduce the benefits. That first C in CPAP is for continuous, meaning that it pushes in air when you breathe in but it also pushes in air when you breathe out. You are fighting against it as you exhale, and I would wake up suffocating. There was the continual embrace of the mask, clamped to my face. Air would leak out around the edges and dry my eyes, even though they were closed.</p>
<p>Most nights at some point I would wake up and rip the mask off. In the morning, I would check the stats and see how little it was working. I went back to Northshore, where Shives would fiddle with the pressure settings or encourage me to try other masks. I returned several times, and began to feel like a regular. Nothing seemed to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally Shives, exasperated, said, &ldquo;You know, if you lost 30 pounds, the problem might go away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While it is possible to be thin and have sleep apnoea, obesity multiplies the probability.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 5'9 and weighed 150 pounds when I graduated from college. In 2009, I weighed 210 pounds.</p>
<p>So in 2010, I decided to lose the weight. I had a goal &ndash; the 30-pound figure Shives recommended. And I did it, going from 208 pounds on 1 January 2010 to 178 pounds on 31 December. Losing the weight did the trick. No more mask.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__image-text"><div class="inline-image inline-image--card"><div class="inline-image__image inline-image__image--card"><img draggable="false" title="Surgeons in operating theatre" srcSet="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/189_106/images/live/p0/85/qw/p085qwnx.jpg 189w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/304_171/images/live/p0/85/qw/p085qwnx.jpg 304w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/85/qw/p085qwnx.jpg 624w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/85/qw/p085qwnx.jpg 976w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/1280_720/images/live/p0/85/qw/p085qwnx.jpg 1280w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/1600_900/images/live/p0/85/qw/p085qwnx.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 70vw, 100vw" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/85/qw/p085qwnx.jpg" alt="Surgeons in operating theatre" id=""/></div><div class="inline-image__line"><div class="styled-line styled-line--grey styled-line--large"></div></div><div class="inline-image__description inline-image__description--desktop"><div class="text-summary"><p class="text-summary__text text-summary__text--blue text-summary__text--center">People with sleep apnoea are at increased risk for certain complications during surgery (Credit: Getty Images)</p></div></div><div class="inline-image__line"><div class="styled-line styled-line--grey styled-line--large"></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__body-text"><div class="body-text-card"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--future body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p>But it turns out I mistook winning a single year&rsquo;s battle with victory in the war. The pounds I had lost somehow found me again, 20 of the 30 creeping slowly back on over the next decade. And with them, the apnoea came back. Not that I realised it until the summer of 2019, when I underwent spine surgery. The pre-surgery questionnaire at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago asked if I sometimes snored, if I was often tired and if I had ever been diagnosed with sleep apnoea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, yes and yes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to screen people for sleep apnoea because it could be a risk when having surgery,&rdquo; says Phyllis Zee, director of the Center for Circadian and Sleep Medicine at Northwestern University&rsquo;s Feinberg School of Medicine. It can be a risk factor for poor outcomes afterwards as well.</p>
<p>The questions about snoring and exhaustion are important because, despite the efforts of medical science to spread the word, most people with apnoea don&rsquo;t realise they have it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A 2017 German study found that while obstructive sleep apnoea might be present in as much as 40% of the general German population, <a href="https://www.valueinhealthjournal.com/article/S1098-3015(17)32249-0/fulltext">only 1.8% of hospital in-patients were identified as having it</a>, which the authors said was possibly due to low awareness of the condition among both patients and hospital staff.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__pull-quote"><div class="inline-quote"><div class="inline-quote__open-quote"><div class="open-quote gelicon--quote open-quote--large"></div></div><blockquote class="inline-quote__blockquote"><div class="inline-quote__text inline-quote__text--desktop"><h2 class="simple-header simple-header--condensed-bold simple-header--large">Weight loss is curative.

One in four candidates for elective surgery have it, but for certain groups, the rate is even higher &ndash; eight in ten patients being treated for obesity, for instance, have it, resulting in a range of risks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patients with sleep apnea undergoing orthopedic or general surgery appeared to be at increased risk for pulmonary complications and need for intensive care services, which significantly increase health care costs,&rdquo; the authors noted.</p>
<p>My revealing on the pre-surgical questionnaire that I previously was diagnosed with sleep apnoea had immediate effects. My spine surgery was done quickly &ndash; taking place a week after I first went over my MRI with a surgeon &ndash; but in that brief period the hospital insisted I undergo a home sleep study to gauge the severity of the apnoea. Instead of going to a sleep centre, I brought home a kit that instructed me how to place sensor bands around my chest, a pulse oximeter on my finger, and a clip under my nose to monitor breathing. There was no EEG, and one drawback of these take-home tests is the units never know if you are actually asleep or not while the readings are being made.</p>
<p>Still, lowering the cost and inconvenience of diagnosis offers hope that more people will discover they have apnoea &ndash; the expense and time needed to have an in-lab polysomnogram is thought to be one reason diagnosis rates are so low.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The test found I had moderate apnoea &ndash; perhaps a function of keeping that last 10 pounds off &ndash; information the anaesthesiologist used when putting me under.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__image-text"><div class="inline-image inline-image--card"><div class="inline-image__image inline-image__image--card"><img draggable="false" title="Dental appliance for sleep apnoea" srcSet="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/189_106/images/live/p0/85/qw/p085qwrc.jpg 189w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/304_171/images/live/p0/85/qw/p085qwrc.jpg 304w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/85/qw/p085qwrc.jpg 624w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/85/qw/p085qwrc.jpg 976w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/1280_720/images/live/p0/85/qw/p085qwrc.jpg 1280w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/1600_900/images/live/p0/85/qw/p085qwrc.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 70vw, 100vw" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/85/qw/p085qwrc.jpg" alt="Dental appliance for sleep apnoea" id=""/></div><div class="inline-image__line"><div class="styled-line styled-line--grey styled-line--large"></div></div><div class="inline-image__description inline-image__description--desktop"><div class="text-summary"><p class="text-summary__text text-summary__text--blue text-summary__text--center">A dental appliance that brings the lower jaw forward has been used to treat sleep apnoea since the 1990s (Credit: Getty Images)</p></div></div><div class="inline-image__line"><div class="styled-line styled-line--grey styled-line--large"></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__body-text"><div class="body-text-card"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--future body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p>&ldquo;Weight loss is curative,&rdquo; says Philip Smith, a professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and a specialist in pulmonary disease and sleep apnoea. &ldquo;The problem is, people can&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Add to this the fact that many patients can&rsquo;t use CPAP, and it becomes clear that there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;critical unmet need,&rdquo; says Schwartz. So over the past two decades, a series of other treatments have been rolled out.</p>
<p>In the mid-1990s, a dental appliance began to be used by those who couldn&rsquo;t tolerate the mask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obstructive sleep apnoea happens in the back of your mouth,&rdquo; says David Turok, a general dentist with a practice concentrating on apnoea. &ldquo;Basically, your tongue doesn&rsquo;t have enough room in your mouth and pushes back into your airway. CPAP forces the tongue out of the way by forcing air down. An oral appliance brings the lower jaw forward, and the tongue comes with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Think of it as a brace, using upper teeth as an anchor to push the lower teeth, and with them the lower jaw, forward, widening the airway at the back of the throat.</p>
<p>Like CPAP, the oral appliance is also an imperfect solution. It holds the jaw in an unnatural position, so it can be uncomfortable, and prolonged use can change your bite, leaving the jaw forward. The pressure of it can also alter the position of your teeth a little bit.</p>
<p>Yet in his years of working on apnoea treatments, the majority of Turok&rsquo;s patients have had success with an oral appliance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But these are mild-to-moderate cases,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;For someone with severe sleep apnoea, CPAP is preferred. I never say you have a choice. You&rsquo;ve got to try CPAP first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says that the surest way to address apnoea, for patients who can&rsquo;t adjust to either CPAP or oral appliances, is jaw-advancement surgery, a better procedure than widening the soft tissue of the throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Recovery is easier because it is bone healing instead of tissue healing,&rdquo; Turok says. Though the surgery is not without drawbacks, including the need to break your lower jaw in two places and have your mouth wired shut after surgery.</p>
<p>A further strategy is, in essence, an electrical version of the oral appliance: hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HNS), where a small electrical charge is used to make the tongue contract and stop it falling backwards during sleep.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__image-text"><div class="inline-image inline-image--card"><div class="inline-image__image inline-image__image--card"><img draggable="false" title="Hand putting pills in medication box" srcSet="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/189_106/images/live/p0/85/qw/p085qwwm.jpg 189w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/304_171/images/live/p0/85/qw/p085qwwm.jpg 304w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/85/qw/p085qwwm.jpg 624w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/85/qw/p085qwwm.jpg 976w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/1280_720/images/live/p0/85/qw/p085qwwm.jpg 1280w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/1600_900/images/live/p0/85/qw/p085qwwm.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 70vw, 100vw" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/85/qw/p085qwwm.jpg" alt="Hand putting pills in medication box" id=""/></div><div class="inline-image__line"><div class="styled-line styled-line--grey styled-line--large"></div></div><div class="inline-image__description inline-image__description--desktop"><div class="text-summary"><p class="text-summary__text text-summary__text--blue text-summary__text--center">Researchers hope to have a pill to treat sleep apnoea in the next decade.

<p>He points out that while obstructive sleep apnoea is viewed as a single condition, it is prompted by a multitude of causes &ndash; facial and throat configuration, muscle tension, obesity &ndash; and so not every treatment works the same for every patient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have very effective treatments, but all have some downsides. It&rsquo;s a matter of matching the right treatment to the right patient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There really is only one test: &ldquo;Make sure it works,&rdquo; he says, noting that &ldquo;we still have a ways to go&rdquo; when it comes to perfecting treatment.</p>
<p>Much hope is centring on that treatment someday being a pill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The future is neurochemical,&rdquo; says Smith of Johns Hopkins. &ldquo;We can treat apnoea in a mouse. Probably in the next ten years, maybe five, you&rsquo;ll be able to take medication for sleep apnoea, because it&rsquo;s a neural-chemical problem. It&rsquo;s not obesity itself, not fat pressing on the airway, but fat excreting certain hormones that makes the airway collapse.&rdquo; Schwartz is more circumspect &ndash; he thinks &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a combination of the two&rdquo; &ndash; but has also been investigating hormones secreted by fat cells.</p>
<p>There are also promising human trials. Phyllis Zee was co-lead author of <a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/41/1/zsx184/4600041">a 2017 paper</a> that found that dronabinol, a synthetic version of a molecule found in cannabis, is &ldquo;safe and well tolerated&rdquo; and lowers the severity of sleep apnoea compared to a placebo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The CPAP device targets the physical problem but not the cause,&rdquo; Zee said at the time of publication. &ldquo;The drug targets the brain and nerves that regulate the upper airway muscles. It alters the neurotransmitters from the brain that communicate with the muscles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are other hopeful signs. A small double-blind<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30395486"> international study</a> of two drugs used in combination &ndash; atomoxetine and oxybutynin &ndash; found that they &ldquo;greatly reduced&rdquo; apnoea, cutting airway obstructions during sleep by at least 50 per cent in all of the participants.</p>
<p>But for a person like me, struggling with apnoea now, the wait might be a long one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been predicting in 20 years we&rsquo;re going to have some drug to deal with the problem,&rdquo; says Schwartz. &ldquo;The only problem is, it&rsquo;s been a rolling 20-year backlog. We&rsquo;ll get there, I have no doubt. There are a couple of promising pharmacological approaches that may be on the horizon.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Patience and healthcare are often linked, whether waiting for new treatments creeping to market, waiting for changes in lifestyle to bear fruit, or even waiting to see the right specialist. For me, it was back to long-term dieting and an appointment with a sleep specialist at Northwestern.</p>
<p>As an indicator of just how many people are dealing with this condition, I got in touch with Northwestern in July, when I had my surgery and learned the apnoea had returned. They said they would schedule me for the first available appointment &ndash; not until late October.</p>

Amy Herrold at Northwestern University&rsquo;s Feinberg School of Medicine, in Chicago, explains that oral contraceptives work by regulating the levels of sex hormones in the body. &ldquo;So instead of having hormonal surges and dips, over the course of a month, it&rsquo;s more consistent,&rdquo; says Herrold, who also works as a research scientist at the Edward Hines, Jr. VA Hospital in Illinois.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EProvided that the pill continues to be taken after the concussion, that could prevent the sudden fall in progesterone, which would explain the less severe symptoms.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EComplicating matters, the surges in oestrogen and progesterone during the luteal phase might also influence dopamine signalling. Dopamine is implicated in many of the brain&rsquo;s functions that are influenced by concussion &ndash; including motivation, mood, memory and concentration &ndash; making it a good contender for a potential mechanism.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERaghupathi&rsquo;s team&rsquo;s recent work on animals suggests that the surge of hormones during the luteal phase could render dopamine receptors slightly more vulnerable to perturbation. So, if a head injury occurs during this time, it seems to throw the dopamine signalling off balance in the long term, with potentially important ramifications for those many different brain functions. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the disruption of this connectivity between cells [and] between regions that is a potential basis for the behavioural problems,&rdquo; Raghupathi says.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut, as Tracey Covassin emphasises, we still don&rsquo;t know how much truth these hypotheses hold. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say any of them are clearly determined at this point.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe different explanations aren&rsquo;t mutually exclusive: further research may find that the differences in musculature, blood flow, and the balance of hormones and neurotransmitters all contribute.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFuture research will also have to investigate other longer-term consequences of concussion. There are concerns, for example, that head impacts can increase the risk of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer&rsquo;s.

This was designed to simulate social stress. A further 23 performed the same test but were subjected to a different kind of social evaluation: they could see the frowning faces of invigilators while completing the puzzles. The results of the test were stark: the participants who lived in a city demonstrated a greater neurophysiological reaction to the same stress-inducing situation. The amygdala, an area of the brain which processes emotion, was activated more strongly in current urban dwellers. The test also showed a difference between those who&rsquo;d grown up in cities and those brought up in towns or the countryside. The former displayed a stronger response in their perigenual anterior cingulate cortex, which regulates the amygdala and is associated with stress and negative emotion.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EMeyer-Lindenberg&rsquo;s previous work on risk mechanisms in schizophrenia focused on genes.

Not in the way you might expect. Her tummy grumbled, yes, she could hear it. She just couldn&rsquo;t feel it. She called it &ldquo;starvation mode&rdquo;. Wright, a mother of three living in Aberdeen, had hit a low point. But she needed to provide for her children, who then were just entering their teens.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the time she was faced with the prospect of watching her own children go without, she had fallen out of contact with her parents and the rest of her family. She&rsquo;d wanted a fresh start. Except that at that moment, in 2013, a fresh start was looking pretty far off. Her partner had left and her benefits were falling short. Now and again, she took paid housework jobs but never made enough money. She would scan her cupboards in despair, hoping there would be enough soup or tins of beans to at least get the next lunch together.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause there was always so little to go around, it didn&rsquo;t take long before she started skipping meals. The effects soon materialised. She was tired all the time &ndash; and yet she couldn&rsquo;t sleep. She was hungry, but she didn&rsquo;t want to eat, and, if she did, she would sometimes be sick. Her head was frazzled. It was hard to keep a string of thoughts together.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWright was exhausted but desperate not to reveal the extent of her fatigue to her children. So she would walk around the house with one hand on the furniture, holding herself steady. A severe iron deficiency, she eventually learned, accounted for the terrible fatigue and it had also made her dizzy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it wasn&rsquo;t her own wellbeing that she worried about most. It was her children&rsquo;s. Try as she might, she couldn&rsquo;t hide from them the fact that she wasn&rsquo;t well. They asked her questions: Why was she dizzy all the time? Why was she taking those pills from the doctor?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd one day she came home to find a glass of milk on the table. Her son, worried about her, had poured it. He made her drink it while he watched &ndash; to make sure she had it all.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;It shouldn&rsquo;t be like that,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Kids shouldn&rsquo;t be worrying about their parents like that.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday, her biggest concern is not that her physical health took a hit, but that her children&rsquo;s mental health did. What psychological scars were left, in the wake of watching their mother starve herself?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happened to Wright and her family is common to far more households in wealthy countries than some may think. Food insecurity, also known as food poverty, is on the rise in the UK, the ninth-richest country in the world. The exact extent is unknown. But many other countries are struggling with this problem. There are millions of families in Europe, the US and Canada, for example, that are facing food insecurity right now.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFood banks, which hand out free supplies of food to those in need, have become more and more common in places where food insecurity has become a persistent problem. (The Trussell Trust, which runs food banks in the UK, recently reported a \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.theguardian.com\u002Fsociety\u002F2019\u002Fapr\u002F25\u002Ffood-bank-network-hands-out-record-16m-food-parcels-in-a-year\"\u003E19% year-on-year increase in the number of food parcels dished out in the UK - up to 1.6 million in total\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.) But even groups like the Trussell Trust agree that food banks cannot be a long-term solution. The food they provide can vary in quantity and quality &ndash; often it is nutritionally limited. Systemic reform, charitable organisations say, is needed to stop families falling into the hunger trap.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScientists have shown that hunger isn&rsquo;t just something transient. Hunger during childhood can have a ripple effect that we are only just beginning to understand. The long-term physical and psychological consequences of hunger are serious and have implications for the health of society itself. Food insecurity may be a ticking time-bomb for today&rsquo;s hungry generations &ndash; just how dangerous is it?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20190429-why-food-poverty-is-a-health-time-bomb-0"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"Image","iFrameType":"","image":["p077rr42"],"imageAlignment":"centre","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20190429-why-food-poverty-is-a-health-time-bomb-1"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp\u003EIt was at a charity that helped local people find employment that someone first mentioned the term &ldquo;food bank&rdquo; to Wright. But she flinched at the idea. &ldquo;No way,&rdquo; she thought. She was terrified that, should she seek help at a food bank, social services would take her children away. It was a reflexive reaction, she feels, left over from childhood. Her own parents distrusted outside agencies and told their children that should anyone come to the house, &ldquo;keep your mouths shut&rdquo;.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo Wright came up with a plan. She would apply to become a volunteer at the food bank instead. &ldquo;It felt a bit better,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;for it to be a bit of a trade.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a volunteer she might get some support, the odd bit of food. It was worth a shot. During the first few days, she felt awkward and out of place. But then one of the workers, Kelly Donaldson, took her under her wing. She soon learned what Wright was going through, so now and again Donaldson would put a small pack of food together for her new friend at the end of the day. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your supper for tonight,&rdquo; she would tell Wright, encouragingly, handing over the bag.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat food bank was the one in central Aberdeen run by Community Food Initiatives North East &ndash; known as CFine. Besides the food bank, CFine offers cooking courses and subsidised fruit and vegetables. And it&rsquo;s at CFine&rsquo;s HQ that I first meet Wright in person. I arrive on a busy Wednesday, as people queue up for three-day food parcels. Helpers are passing around specific items as a small queue forms at the door.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe food parcels are presented as nondescript white carrier bags stuffed with milk, several tins of food, cereal, rice or pasta, and sauce. Within about 20 minutes, two rows of the bags stacked on shelves disappear. It won&rsquo;t be long until they&rsquo;re replenished. I&rsquo;m told that a few weeks ago, CFine gave out 179 of these bags in a single day, the highest number the charity had ever recorded.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReliance on food banks in Aberdeen is high. There are 20 such services in the city &ndash; more than in any other city in Scotland, including the more populated Glasgow and Edinburgh. Food banks are becoming a more common sight in many places &ndash; for example in rural US communities, in Canadian cities, and in wealthy European countries. Scotland is by no means an outlier.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore we get a chance to meet, I spot Wright darting into an interview room to give advice to a young man. He has long hair, camo trousers. His dog has come with him. Wright is now part of the financial capability team. It&rsquo;s her job to help people manage their finances. The role includes assisting them with benefits applications &ndash; exactly the sort of hoops she had had to learn to jump through herself, in order to keep her family fed.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWright tells me she still worries about what her children have been through.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;My children&rsquo;s health wasn&rsquo;t compromised in the physical sense, but I would say in terms of their mental wellbeing, absolutely,&rdquo; she explains. &ldquo;They were concerned and worried about their mum. They were anxious about going to school because they weren&rsquo;t sure about what was going on with my health.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESigns are gathering apace that more and more children in rich countries are experiencing hunger and its negative effects. Just over a week before my visit to Scotland, the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights criticised the British government for the scenes of poverty he had witnessed on a trip to the UK. The extent of child poverty in the UK was, he said, &ldquo;not just a disgrace, but a social calamity and an economic disaster, all rolled into one&rdquo;.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe situation is no better across the Atlantic. In the US, one in five children go to school hungry. Canada had its own visit from a UN special rapporteur in 2012.

But she also tracks research that explores the long-term effects on children who live in food-insecure homes.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStudies by a team at the University of Calgary, including Sharon Kirkpatrick and Lynn McIntyre, have shown that going hungry just a handful of times is associated with poorer physical and mental health. It also means that children are less likely to finish school.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn one six-year study, McIntyre and colleagues found that young people who had experienced hunger had a significantly higher risk of developing depressive symptoms. And another large analysis showed that children who went hungry were similarly at risk of developing some kind of health problem within the next 10 years. Hunger, the researchers wrote, had a &ldquo;toxic&rdquo; effect: &ldquo;Higher odds of chronic conditions and of asthma were observed among youth who experienced multiple episodes of hunger compared with those who were never hungry.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese findings held up even when other things that could influence health were factored in &ndash; hunger really does appear to play a defining role.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;The exposure that children have leaves an indelible mark on them,&rdquo; says Tarasuk. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really a bad idea to be leaving so many languishing in this situation.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe team are initially focusing on young people who present with one of four &ldquo;tracer&rdquo; conditions &ndash; eczema, constipation, asthma and epilepsy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the UK, long-term data like that used by Tarasuk and her colleagues is hard to come by.

However, this will soon change: the Department for Work and Pensions is to include questions about food insecurity in its annual household survey of living standards. The first data will be available in 2021.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConditions associated with food insecurity are already very visible to doctors, however. One who regularly sees the effects of hunger in children is Ronny Cheung, a consultant general paediatrician in London. He sends me data that shows how, in the past 20 years, England has seen a noticeable rise in rickets cases that have required hospitalisation. There are now more child hospitalisations for rickets than at any time in the past five decades. Rickets may not always be tied solely to diet, because the vitamin D deficiency can also be caused by a lack of sunlight. However, &ldquo;nutritional rickets&rdquo; is diagnosable when it becomes clear that a child&rsquo;s food intake has been sub-par.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I meet him in a tiny office in a central London hospital, Cheung recalls the case of an 18-month-old boy he treated recently. The boy&rsquo;s mother had taken him to the GP because he was having difficulty learning to walk. When Cheung brought him in for more detailed examination, it became clear why. He was severely bow-legged, a distinctive symptom of rickets. Not only that, but the boy had developed bony nobbles at the ends of his ribs all the way up, known as a rachitic rosary.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;This is really rare,&rdquo; Cheung tells me. &ldquo;This is like textbook stuff that no one sees, and this kid had them because the deficiency was so severe.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce he had talked to the boy&rsquo;s mother about his diet, it became clear this was a case of nutritional rickets.

She is a project leader at a charity called Centrestage, which is based in the town of Kilmarnock, south-west of Glasgow. Her job is to manage two programmes: one that provides fresh meals to people in deprived areas and another that runs community cooking courses.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore she worked here Boyd was employed by a bank. Then her friend, who worked for Centrestage, took her on a tour of the charity&rsquo;s activities. She was overwhelmed. Her friend announced that there was a job opening &ndash; it was Boyd&rsquo;s if she wanted it. She didn&rsquo;t have to think twice before accepting.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;I just saw the help that&rsquo;s here for these people, that I wasn&rsquo;t able to do in the bank,&rdquo; she explains. The spark had ignited in her mind: &ldquo;I can go out and help these people.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen Centrestage was launched, 13 years ago, its founders had no intention of feeding people. They wanted to provide a theatre group for locals. The idea was to put on big shows with a bit more buzz and pizzazz than is possible for, say, school drama departments. Plus, anyone would be able to join in, no matter their age or background.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was only as the leaders started working more closely with local communities that they realised food insecurity was such a problem &ndash; indeed, it could even be a barrier to people taking part in something like a theatre project. If you&rsquo;re hungry, you can&rsquo;t be expected to perform in front of hundreds or work for hours backstage.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECentrestage continues to put on community shows, but filling bellies is now a key objective. The group&rsquo;s slogan is &ldquo;Fun, food, folk.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;That&rsquo;s our motto,&rdquo; says Boyd. &ldquo;Everything is fun, everything is making sure people are relaxed, they feel welcome, they don&rsquo;t feel intimidated, they don&rsquo;t feel judged.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe has seen for herself how a lack of food can take its toll on young people. Children may become fatigued due to hunger &ndash; but they may also experience the opposite effect. For children with ADHD, for example, hunger can trigger hyperactivity. At one cooking course, Boyd&rsquo;s effort to start the class was hampered by a boy running around the room. She handed out sandwiches. &ldquo;Once he&rsquo;d eaten, he calmed down,&rdquo; she says.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECentrestage&rsquo;s On the Road project is a double-decker bus that travels around and dishes up meals. Boyd is eager to show me the bus, which today is in an area called Shortlees, in the south of Kilmarnock where, shockingly, 37% of children live in poverty. But before I see the bus, I need to witness the kitchen that churns out thousands of prepared meals every week, says Boyd.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe pull up to a big grey warehouse unit on an industrial estate. The sky is grey too. But when the door beeps as we enter Centrestage&rsquo;s unit, the smell of cooking suddenly provides colour. Chefs hurry about, all in black and comfy walking shoes, with jugs of various mixtures or huge trays for the ovens.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe food portions cooked here are given to people at Centrestage locations. You can also buy them, for just a pound or so, in the caf&eacute;. I try one later &ndash; pasta with roast vegetables, a tasty sauce and some cheese sprinkled on top. A genuinely enjoyable meal. Also available that day was paneer curry with rice, and pots of red pepper soup.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20190429-why-food-poverty-is-a-health-time-bomb-10"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"Image","iFrameType":"","image":["p077rvd5"],"imageAlignment":"centre","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20190429-why-food-poverty-is-a-health-time-bomb-11"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp\u003EAs the bus&rsquo;s driver, Ian Maconochie, says, food banks often ask for vouchers &ndash; or &ldquo;chitties&rdquo; &ndash; before handing out supplies. &ldquo;Nae chitties here,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;nae chitties.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVolunteers will happily hand out food for free, though they do ask if people can try to budget each week and make a small donation, say a pound or two pounds. Either way, Maconochie says, no one gets turned away. The number of people that make use of the bus and Centrestage&rsquo;s other food distribution points is staggering. Between July and September 2018, adults received food nearly 6,000 times and children on about 2,200 occasions.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other part of Boyd&rsquo;s role involves helping people to learn to cook so they can better fend for themselves. Centrestage has acquired an old school in Kilmarnock, which in the next few years will be remodelled to become the charity&rsquo;s headquarters. The old canteen will become a caf&eacute; serving low-cost meals. The assembly hall will be converted into their flagship theatre space. Classrooms will be let out to local initiatives seeking to teach people skills such as hairdressing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the old home economics department will be where Boyd organises her cooking courses.

People&rsquo;s wellbeing can very quickly be affected by hunger, but that&rsquo;s never the whole story. So besides the cheap meals and cooking workshops, Centrestage staff and volunteers aim to help with benefits forms, or housing applications or employment issues. The woman bringing her daughter to the bus was right: this isn&rsquo;t a food bank. It&rsquo;s much more than that. As Boyd puts it, &ldquo;We can say, &lsquo;Right, what&rsquo;s going on? We can help you in any other way.&rsquo;&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerry Wright and her colleagues at CFine in Aberdeen also find themselves providing a wide range of support to local people. Charities like this aim to get under the skin of something much bigger: deprivation itself. Food might just be the first thing that brings someone through the door.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECFine&rsquo;s chief executive, Dave Simmers, would like his organisation to focus on helping people to help themselves. But the level of crisis he sees people in means running the food bank as well is essential.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t like food banks at all,&rdquo; he says, as the workers hand out the food parcels just a few feet away from his office door. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not helpful, they erode dignity, they create dependence and they change nothing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;But, essentially, people are hungry.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWright&rsquo;s life may have been saved by CFine&rsquo;s food bank, even though she came to it ostensibly as a volunteer rather than a user. And yet Simmers&rsquo;s point about food banks being unhelpful makes sense in the wider context of a hungry nation. Improving the fairness of the benefits system&nbsp;and monitoring and safeguarding child nutrition&nbsp;would be some first steps that could move families away from reliance on food banks.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETransforming lives \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor Wright, it was working for a food charity that really got her back on her feet, not access to free food. Today, she expresses a true zeal for the job she does. She now works 29 hours per week at CFine. She finally has a steady flow of income. This year, she says, she will become debt-free for the first time in a long time. She&rsquo;s being very cautious, though. If it&rsquo;s a bit chilly, she tries not to put an extra &pound;10 in the gas meter &ndash; in case it means she gets low on food the following week.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut her children&rsquo;s physical health is good.

With no money in a strange city, Misty found the bus system too confusing to navigate. The longer she went without her cocktail of antipsychotics to keep the worst symptoms of her schizoaffective disorder at bay, the more difficult it became to remember that she even needed medication. In the sweltering July heat, Misty roamed the streets of Santa Monica, trying to grab a few minutes of shut-eye where she could. Mostly, she was too afraid to sleep.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMisty&rsquo;s worsening mental state left her combative and paranoid. Her memories of this time are vague at best, but hospital records show a series of psychiatric hospitalisations during July and August. She was arrested at least once. By now, Misty no longer recognised that she had a health problem. Not surprisingly, she didn&rsquo;t take her medications once out of hospital, and the cycle repeated itself over and over.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack in Modesto, Misty&rsquo;s mother, Linda, felt her worry turn to panic as the days passed without word from her daughter.

Wandering the streets and shouting at strangers, without adequate food and water, didn&rsquo;t qualify.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat Misty needed, Linda believed, was a programme that would require her to take the medications that had been helping her in Modesto without having to be admitted to hospital. A bill in California could enforce this, but it had not been passed in Stanislaus County. Known as Laura&rsquo;s Law, the bill allows courts to order what&rsquo;s known as assisted outpatient treatment (AOT) to people with severe mental illness if they meet specific criteria, including previous hospitalisations or arrests, being noncompliant with outpatient treatment, and becoming dangerous to themselves or others.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe law, however, is not without its critics. Civil rights advocates argue that the state shouldn&rsquo;t have the right to deprive someone of their liberties with forced treatment. Some psychiatrists say that AOT simply doesn&rsquo;t work. Linda&rsquo;s quest to get Laura&rsquo;s Law passed in Modesto, together with Misty&rsquo;s experiences in LA, highlight the high-stakes battle to find the best ways to help people with severe mental illness who, like Misty, may not recognise their own condition.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E*\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a leading neurologist at the H&ocirc;pital de la Piti&eacute; in Paris, Joseph Babinski was used to seeing all sorts of unusual phenomena.

What did strike him was that both patients insisted they were completely normal. They were unaware that there was anything wrong with them. In a 1914 medical journal article, Babinski explained that when he recommended electrotherapy to one of these patients, she replied, &ldquo;Why do you want to electrify me? I am not paralysed.&rdquo; He coined a new word to describe this symptom: \u003Cem\u003Eanosognosia\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, literally meaning &lsquo;without knowledge&rsquo;.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20180806-how-do-you-treat-someone-who-doesnt-accept-theyre-ill-0"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"PullQuote","iFrameType":"","pullQuote":"For Linda Mayo, the question of her daughter&rsquo;s right to refuse treatment must be balanced against her right to have a roof over her head and food on the table","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20180806-how-do-you-treat-someone-who-doesnt-accept-theyre-ill-1"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp\u003EUnlike in denial, when an individual knows there&rsquo;s something wrong but insists they&rsquo;re fine, Babinski believed that his patients weren&rsquo;t fibbing or confused; they genuinely had no concept that half their body was paralysed. Something in their brains &ndash; he couldn&rsquo;t say what &ndash; was damaged. For the next eight decades, anosognosia featured exclusively in the neurology literature, associated with physical conditions. Not until the mid-1990s did a few psychiatrists begin to try and apply the word to their patients, too. The pushback came almost immediately.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea that some people with mental illness lack insight into their condition wasn&rsquo;t new.

As new legislation narrowed the criteria by which patients could be involuntarily committed, many people affected by mental illness were excluded.

Eyes open.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the second night in three that Angelina has been deliberately deprived of sleep. For a person with bipolar disorder who has spent the past two years in a deep and crippling depression, it may sound like the last thing she needs, but Angelina &ndash; and the doctors treating her &ndash; hope it will be her salvation. For two decades, Francesco Benedetti, who heads the psychiatry and clinical psychobiology unit at San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, has been investigating so-called wake therapy, in combination with bright light exposure and lithium, as a means of treating depression where drugs have often failed. As a result, psychiatrists in the USA, the UK and other European countries are starting to take notice, launching variations of it in their own clinics. These &lsquo;chronotherapies&rsquo; seem to work by kick-starting a sluggish biological clock; in doing so, they&rsquo;re also shedding new light on the underlying pathology of depression, and on the function of sleep more generally.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;Sleep deprivation really has opposite effects in healthy people and those with depression,&rdquo; says Benedetti. If you&rsquo;re healthy and you don&rsquo;t sleep, you&rsquo;ll feel in a bad mood. But if you&rsquo;re depressed, it can prompt an immediate improvement in mood, and in cognitive abilities. But, Benedetti adds, there&rsquo;s a catch: once you go to sleep and catch up on those missed hours of sleep, you&rsquo;ll have a 95% chance of relapse.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe antidepressant effect of sleep deprivation was first published in a report in Germany in 1959. This captured the imagination of a young researcher from Tubingen in Germany, Burkhard Pflug, who investigated the effect in his doctoral thesis and in subsequent studies during the 1970s. By systematically depriving depressed people of sleep, he confirmed that spending a single night awake could jolt them out of depression.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBenedetti became interested in this idea as a young psychiatrist in the early 1990s. Prozac had been launched just a few years earlier, hailing a revolution in the treatment of depression. But such drugs were rarely tested on people with bipolar disorder. Bitter experience has since taught Benedetti that antidepressants are largely ineffective for people with bipolar depression anyway.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20180123-can-staying-awake-beat-depression-0"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"PullQuote","iFrameType":"","pullQuote":"We decided to give them the whole package, and the effect was brilliant &ndash; Francesco Benedetti, psychologist","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20180123-can-staying-awake-beat-depression-1"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp\u003EHis patients were in desperate need of an alternative, and his supervisor, Enrico Smeraldi, had an idea up his sleeve.

They drive hundreds of different cellular processes, enabling them to keep time with one another and turn on and off. A circadian clock ticks in every cell of your body, including your brain cells, and they are coordinated by an area of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which responds to light.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;When people are seriously depressed, their circadian rhythms tend to be very flat; they don&rsquo;t get the usual response of melatonin rising in the evening, and the cortisol levels are consistently high rather than falling in the evening and the night,&rdquo; says Steinn Steingrimsson, a psychiatrist at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg, Sweden, who is currently running a trial of wake therapy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecovery from depression is associated with a normalisation of these cycles. &ldquo;I think depression may be one of the consequences of this basic flattening of circadian rhythms and homeostasis in the brain,&rdquo; says Benedetti. &ldquo;When we sleep-deprive depressed people, we restore this cyclical process.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut how does this restoration come about? One possibility is that depressed people simply need added sleep pressure to jump-start a sluggish system.

It builds up throughout the day and attaches to adenosine receptors on neurons, making us feel drowsy. Drugs that trigger these receptors have the same effect, whereas drugs that block them &ndash; such as caffeine &ndash; make us feel more awake.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo investigate whether this process might underpin the antidepressant effects of prolonged wakefulness, researchers at Tufts University in Massachusetts took mice with depression-like symptoms and administered high doses of a compound that triggers adenosine receptors, mimicking what happens during sleep deprivation.

In the first study, 75 patients were given the antidepressant duloxetine, in combination with either chronotherapy or daily exercise. After the first week, 41% of the chronotherapy group had experienced a halving of their symptoms, compared to 13% of the exercise group.
