<strong>New York:</strong> Trading on Wall Street was temporarily halted early Monday as US stocks joined a global rout on crashing oil prices and mounting worries over the coronavirus.</p>	  </div>
	  		<div class="paywall">
<p>The suspension was triggered after the S&amp;P 500's losses hit seven percent, with trading resuming after 15 minutes.</p>	  
<p>The most violent drops came from the oil markets, where prices cratered more than 20%. But moves in stocks and bond yields were nearly as breathtaking. In the United States, the S&amp;P 500 plunged 7% in the first few minutes of trading, and losses were so sharp that trading was halted. Crude oil logged its worst day in almost three decades, sending oil majors Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp down more than 9%. The energy index slumped 20.1%.</p>	  
<p>Near 1400 GMT, the broad-based S&amp;P 500 was down 6.6 per cent at 2,776.47.</p>	  
<p>The benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 6.9 per cent to 24,087.20, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index fell 6.2 per cent to 8,042.17.</p>	  
<p>After two difficult weeks amid rising worries over the virus, markets appeared to enter a new phase of worry early Monday after oil producers failed to reach an agreement on a pact to limit output, sending oil futures crashing.</p>	  
<p>The virus itself continued to prompt major economic dislocations, as Italy imposed a month-long lockdown on the country's northern region and additional major sporting events were canceled, along with concerts and industry conferences.</p>	  
<p>The International Monetary Fund called for "substantial" stimulus and international coordination to counteract the economic impact of the spreading coronavirus epidemic, while the New York Federal Reserve Bank announced it will increase its daily injections of cash into financial markets by USD 50 billion to USD 150 billion to boost market liquidity.</p>
