It can either galvanise the players or see them fall apart as soon as the heat goes on.The Bulldogs chose the former over the latter.</p></div></section><div class="_1FVfK"></div><section class="vPaWe"><div class="_1ysFk"><div class="_1665V undefined"><p>Parramatta came out of the gates firing on all cylinders, dominating the first 15 minutes of the match. Blake Ferguson thought he had scored four minutes in. He celebrated with his trademark backflip, only to land, turn around and see the touch judge&#x27;s flag flapping in the breeze.</p><p>A penalty goal from plucky Bulldogs playmaking debutant Brandon Wakeham settled the nerves and swung the momentum of the game. In the blink of an eye, it was the Eels who were forced to do the bulk of the defending. By half-time, the Dogs had enjoyed 56 per cent possession.</p><p>The scoreboard read 2-all at the end of a fast, physical half which had a notable lack of wrestling in the ruck.</p><p>There were no tries in the first half, but the first ever captain&#x27;s challenge in a regular-season match came and went in the 20th minute when Eels skipper Clint Gutherson challenged a Reagan Campbell-Gillard knock-on. It was a poor challenge. Canterbury captain Josh Jackson&#x27;s challenge of a Will Hopoate knock-on early in the second half was arguably worse.</p></div><div class="_1lC_G"></div><div class="_1665V undefined"><p>Thankfully for Dogs fans, their actual football was much better than Jackson&#x27;s challenge. They set up camp in the Eels&#x27; red zone for most of the first 15 minutes of the second half but could not capitalise on a handful of half chances. With 20 minutes to play, the score was still 2-all.</p><figure class="_3ujPS _3x3-4"><div aria-label="enlarge image" class="_1lwW_" role="button" tabindex="0"><picture class=""><source media="(min-width: 1024px)" srcSet="https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.307%2C$multiply_1.0582%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_0%2C$y_4/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/e5bbb44e4b569f19a9b94f90ffa5638710bf40a5, https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.307%2C$multiply_2.1164%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_0%2C$y_4/t_crop_custom/q_62%2Cf_auto/e5bbb44e4b569f19a9b94f90ffa5638710bf40a5 2x"/><source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcSet="https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.307%2C$multiply_0.963%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_0%2C$y_4/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/e5bbb44e4b569f19a9b94f90ffa5638710bf40a5, https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.307%2C$multiply_1.9259%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_0%2C$y_4/t_crop_custom/q_62%2Cf_auto/e5bbb44e4b569f19a9b94f90ffa5638710bf40a5 2x"/><img alt="Nick Meaney tries to break free." src="https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.307%2C$multiply_0.4431%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_0%2C$y_4/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/e5bbb44e4b569f19a9b94f90ffa5638710bf40a5" srcSet="https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.307%2C$multiply_0.4431%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_0%2C$y_4/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/e5bbb44e4b569f19a9b94f90ffa5638710bf40a5, https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.307%2C$multiply_0.8862%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_0%2C$y_4/t_crop_custom/q_62%2Cf_auto/e5bbb44e4b569f19a9b94f90ffa5638710bf40a5 2x"/></picture></div><figcaption class="_3CZmy"><p><span class="_2Li3P">Nick Meaney tries to break free.</span><cite class="ojLwA"><span class="_30ROC">Credit:</span>AAP</cite></p></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, Parramatta were able to string some sustained possession together. When they marched into the Dogs&#x27; red zone, they looked dangerous. That was largely because of Mitchell Moses, who was making the right pass at the right time, all of the time.</p><p>It was Moses who put the grubber in behind the Bulldogs&#x27; line which eventually procured the first try of the season. The ball could not be mopped up by Lachlan Lewis - who was one of Canterbury&#x27;s best - and the ricochet dribbled into the in-goal. Mahoney pinned his ears back and won the race to the ball, breaking the try-scoring drought after 65 minutes. It was the decisive score in a match that Bulldogs fans will probably take more out of than their Eels counterparts.</p></div><div class="_1lC_G"></div><div class="_1665V undefined"><p>Aside from the gritty performance in the most trying of circumstances, there were some shining lights individually.</p><p>Lewis looks like the right man to take the club forward in the halves. His passing was on point, kicking top notch and he aimed up in defence, as he always does.</p><p>There was plenty of talk about Wakeham&#x27;s defence pre-match and the Eels sent plenty of traffic his way. He cut players twice his size down with regularity, though, and looks to have enough spark in attack to keep Jack Cogger out of the team.</p><p>For the Eels it was Moses, Gutherson and forward Shaun Lane who impressed in a performance which coach Brad Arthur would have been happy to nab two points from.</p></div><div class="_22FRK"><div class="iQMz1" hidden=""><div class="_2Xaw4"><h5 class="_3NFLJ"><a title="Articles by Sam Phillips" href="https://www.smh.com.au/by/sam-phillips-h1al6d">Sam Phillips</a></h5><ul class="_2BYUe"><li><a href="https://www.smh.com.aumailto:sam.phillips@fairfaxmedia.com.au"><span class="_3kzaw">Email</span><svg aria-hidden="true" class="QMY9O" focusable="false" height="1em" width="1em"><use xlink:href="#icon-email"></use></svg></a></li></ul></div><p class="_2g0-m">Sam is a sports reporter for The Sydney Morning Herald.</p></div></div></div></section></article></body></article></html>
