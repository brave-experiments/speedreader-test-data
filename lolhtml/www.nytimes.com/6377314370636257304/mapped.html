What Just Happened?</h2><h4 class="css-qsd3hm">Joe Biden had a strong showing, but Bernie Sanders picked up the biggest prize of the night, California. Alex Burns, a Times political reporter, lays out what happened, and what it means for Democrats.</h4></div><dl class="css-p98d0w"><dt class="css-xx7kwh"></dt><dd class="css-12tddc8"><p class="css-8hvvyd">This was a night that was supposed to bring clarity to the Democratic race … “Hello, hello, hello, hello!” “Here’s what is clear.” “I don’t know what’s going to happen later tonight.” … and establish whether there was one clear front-runner or maybe two clear front-runners or no front-runners at all. We’ve covered contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. “Can I get you to wear a button?” “I’m with the press.” “Sure I know, I’m just trying.” And now we’ve arrived at Super Tuesday. Super Tuesday is the single most important date on the primary calendar. You have more than a dozen states and territories voting at the same time. And it is the first real test of which candidates are drawing broad national appeal. “Winston-Salem, thank you!” “Hello, Denver!” “Tennessee will deliver. This is the volunteer state.” The biggest prizes on the map are Texas and California. But all told, you’re looking at about a third of all the delegates that are at stake in the Democratic primary are at stake on Super Tuesday. This was a good night, especially for Joe Biden. “It was a good night! It’s a good night!” We have seen that Biden has been regaining traction in the race over the last couple of days. “It ain’t over, man. We’re just getting started.” But he pulled off a series of big wins and upsets in places where even a newly revived Biden campaign wasn’t terribly optimistic about winning. Over the last few days, we have seen an extraordinary coalescing of support around Joe Biden. “I am ending my campaign and endorsing Joe Biden!” When he collected those endorsements on Monday from Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, that only accelerated his new momentum. So many of Joe Biden’s most important and biggest victories on Super Tuesday came in states where black voters make up either a majority or a very, very large share of the primary electorate. “We just got in Alabama. We won Alabama!” Joe Biden edged out a narrow victory in Texas, but it was a close outcome. And Bernie Sanders recorded very significant support, especially from Latino voters and progressives. This was a solid night for Bernie Sanders. This was not some massive setback. It was not the massive breakthrough that his campaign hoped it would be. But what we did see him do was continue adding significantly to his delegate count in a series of states where his progressive base was strong. “Hi, my name is Tom. I’m from the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign.” Most importantly, California. In his speech on election night— “This will become a contrast in ideas.” —Bernie Sanders made it pretty clear that in the coming weeks he is going to be going after Joe Biden even more aggressively. “One of us in this race led the opposition to the war in Iraq.” It was not such a good night for Michael Bloomberg and Elizabeth Warren. Warren has needed to make a comeback and she did not carry a single state. She even came in third in her home state of Massachusetts. This was the first time that Michael Bloomberg’s name appeared on a ballot in this Democratic primary. He spent hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising and other campaign operations in the Super Tuesday states. In the end, he only won a single contest in American Samoa. For the first time in this campaign, you really have the two wings of the Democratic Party organized under a pair of clear frontrunners— Joe Biden closer to the political center— “Most Americans don’t want the promise of a revolution. They want results. They want a revival of decency, honor, and character.” —and Bernie Sanders further to the left. “From day one, we have been taking on the establishment. It is no surprise— they do not want me to become president.” There is clearly a real hunger among many voters in the party to coalesce quickly around someone they see as an electable challenger for President Trump. Do you want some kind of salutation or— “No, no.” It’s only March and we’ve got a long way to election day. The Times will continue covering the campaign from all angles from the campaign trail to investigations to analysis and beyond. For our latest reporting, go to nytimes.com/2020.

Biden Jr.</a> won Texas, Virginia, North Carolina and at least six other states, largely through support from African-Americans and moderates, while Senator <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/bernie-sanders.html" title="">Bernie Sanders</a> harnessed the backing of liberals and young voters to claim the biggest prize of the campaign, California, and several other primaries.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The returns across the country on the biggest night of voting suggested that the Democratic contest was increasingly focused on two candidates who are standard-bearers for competing wings of the party, Mr. Biden in the political center and Mr. Sanders on the left. Their two other major rivals, Senator <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/elizabeth-warren.html" title="">Elizabeth Warren</a> and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/michael-bloomberg.html" title="">Michael R. Bloomberg</a>, were on track to finish well behind them and faced an uncertain path forward.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Biden’s victories came chiefly in the South and the Midwest, and in some of them he won by unexpectedly wide margins. In a surprising upset, Mr. Biden even captured Ms. Warren’s home state of Massachusetts, where he did not appear in person, and where Mr. Sanders had campaigned aggressively in recent days.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was a remarkable show of force for Mr. Biden, the former vice president. In just three days he resurrected a campaign that had been on the verge of collapse after he lost the first three nominating states. But he bounced back with a landslide win in South Carolina on Saturday, and on Tuesday, in addition to victories in Texas,Virginia, North Carolina and Massachusetts, he prevailed in Arkansas, Alabama, Tennessee, Oklahoma and Minnesota.</p></div><aside class="css-ew4tgv" aria-label="companion column"></aside></div><div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Sanders rebounded late in the evening in delegate-rich Western states: He was quickly declared the winner in Colorado and Utah after polls closed there, and he also claimed the largest delegate lode of the primary race, California, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Sanders also easily carried his home state of Vermont.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yet Mr. Biden’s sweep of states across the South and the Midwest showed he had the makings of a formidable coalition that could propel him through the primaries. As he did in South Carolina, Mr. Biden rolled to victory in several states with the support of large majorities of African-Americans. And he also performed well with a demographic that was crucial to the party’s success in the 2018 midterm elections: college-educated white voters.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We were told, well, when you got to Super Tuesday, it’d be over,” a triumphant Mr. Biden, 77, said at a celebration in Los Angeles. “Well, it may be over for the other guy!”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After a trying stretch in February, even Mr. Biden appeared surprised at the extent of his success. “I’m here to report we are very much alive!’’ he said. “And make no mistake about it, this campaign will send Donald Trump packing.”</p></div><aside class="css-ew4tgv" aria-label="companion column"></aside></div><div class="css-79elbk" data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div class="css-z3e15g"

StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For his part, Mr. Sanders continued to show strength with the voters who have made up his political base: Latinos, liberals and those under age 40. But he struggled to expand his appeal with older voters and African-Americans. </p><div id="NYT_MID_MAIN_CONTENT_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac"></div><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The results also called into question Mr. Sanders’s decision to spend valuable time over the past week campaigning in both Minnesota and Massachusetts, two states where he had hoped to embarrass rivals on their home turf. The gambit proved badly flawed: It was Mr. Biden who pulled off upset wins in both states, with the help of a last-minute endorsement from Senator Amy Klobuchar that upended the race in Minnesota.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The unexpected breadth of Mr. Biden’s success, on a day when more than one-third of the delegates were at stake, illustrated the volatility of this race as well as the determination of many center-left Democrats to find a nominee and get on to challenging President Trump. The former vice president had little advertising and a skeletal organization and scarcely even visited many of the states he won, including liberal-leaning Minnesota and Massachusetts. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But his smashing victory in South Carolina echoed almost instantaneously, and his momentum from there proved far more powerful than the money Mr. Sanders and Mr. Bloomberg had poured into most of Tuesday’s contests.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The early returns were a comprehensive setback for Mr. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, who entered the race late and spent more than half a billion dollars on an aggressive advertising campaign. But Mr. Bloomberg slumped badly after a series of damaging clashes with Ms. Warren, and many moderates and African-Americans appeared to have abandoned him for Mr. Biden. Hours into vote-counting, Mr. Bloomberg had won only one contest, in American Samoa.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Addressing supporters in West Palm Beach, Fla., on Tuesday night, Mr. Bloomberg tried to put the best face on a dismal evening. “Here’s what is clear,” he said. “No matter how many delegates we win tonight, we have done something no one else thought was possible: In just three months, we’ve gone from 1 percent in the polls to being a contender for the Democratic nomination for president.”<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">  </span>Still, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/super-tuesday-03-03#bloomberg-plans-to-make-a-decision-on-his-campaign-on-wednesday" title="">Mr. Bloomberg planned to review </a>Tuesday’s results and decide his path forward in the race, people familiar with the campaign’s plans said.</p></div><aside class="css-ew4tgv" aria-label="companion column"></aside></div><div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Warren’s loss in Massachusetts left her without a single victory after a month of primaries and caucuses, and in many places on Tuesday she was running in a relatively distant third or fourth place. Most dispiriting to Ms. Warren may be that she lost her home state not to Mr. Sanders, who worked hard to defeat her in her home state, but rather Mr. Biden, suggesting that none of the recent tumult in the race had worked to her advantage.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Ms. Warren’s campaign in recent days explicitly laid out a strategy of accumulating delegates for a contested convention, and it was not clear that her latest setbacks would deter that approach. Ms. Warren campaigned on Tuesday in Michigan, which holds a primary next week, and urged voters to “cast the vote that will make you proud” rather than making more calculated assessments. And she has announced campaign stops in Arizona and Idaho, two other states that vote this month.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At Mr. Sanders’s campaign party in Vermont on Tuesday night, he answered Mr. Biden’s surge in the race with a battle cry for his supporters: He proclaimed “absolute confidence” that he would win the Democratic nomination, and delivered a scathing critique of Mr. Biden’s record that left little doubt he would confront Mr. Biden’s revived candidacy in blunt terms in the coming days.</p></div><aside class="css-ew4tgv" aria-label="companion column"></aside></div><figure class="sizeMedium css-qhlm6o" aria-label="media" role="group"><div class="css-bsn42l"><span class="css-1dv1kvn">Video</span><div><div class="css-1t0v8sy etkm6pg0"><div class="css-mm3pwi"><script type="application/ld+json">{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"VideoObject","@id":"https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/elections/100000007011201/bernie-sanders-super-tuesday-2020.html","description":"Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont spoke to supporters in Essex Junction, Vt., on Super Tuesday.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/elections/100000007011201/bernie-sanders-super-tuesday-2020.html","inLanguage":"en-US","name":"Sanders Holds Super Tuesday Rally in Vermont","thumbnailUrl":["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/03/us/politics/03campaign-ledeall-sanders2/merlin_169988214_68805c07-7a8e-41f4-91ab-0efb86a6eea7-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg","https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/03/us/politics/03campaign-ledeall-sanders2/merlin_169988214_68805c07-7a8e-41f4-91ab-0efb86a6eea7-superJumbo.jpg","https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/03/us/politics/03campaign-ledeall-sanders2/merlin_169988214_68805c07-7a8e-41f4-91ab-0efb86a6eea7-mediumSquareAt3X.jpg"],"uploadDate":"2020-03-04T00:02:36.000Z","duration":"PT11M25S"}</script></div><div class="css-eidn6d etkm6pg1"><div class="css-1ihorw etkm6pg2"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/03/us/politics/03campaign-ledeall-sanders2/merlin_169988214_68805c07-7a8e-41f4-91ab-0efb86a6eea7-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg" alt="Video player loading"/></div><div class="css-1ruigs3"><div class="css-v15h5m"><div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><figcaption class="css-17ai7jg emkp2hg0"><span class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont spoke to supporters in Essex Junction, Vt., on Super Tuesday.</span><span class="css-cch8ym"><span class="css-1dv1kvn">Credit</span><span itemProp="copyrightHolder" class="emkp2hg2 css-1fxp258 e1z0qqy90"><span class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</span><span>Erin Schaff/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Without naming the former vice president, Mr. Sanders said there was another candidate in the race who had supported the invasion of Iraq, endorsed cutting Social Security, voted for international trade deals and “represented the credit card companies” by backing a 2005 overhaul of the bankruptcy code. As for himself, Mr. Sanders said, he had stood on the opposite side of every issue.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“You cannot beat Trump with the same-old, same-old kind of politics,” Mr. Sanders said. “What we need is a new politics that brings working-class people into our political movement.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Sanders was on track to rack up delegates in California, but he was sharing some of them with Mr. Biden in his own state of Vermont. And in Colorado, another state Mr. Sanders carried, he was dividing them four ways, as he, Mr. Biden, Mr. Bloomberg and Ms. Warren all reached the 15 percent threshold to win delegates there.</p></div><aside class="css-ew4tgv" aria-label="companion column"></aside></div><div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The voting followed an extraordinary reframing of the race in the past 48 hours, as moderate candidates came together to form a united front against Mr. Sanders, a democratic socialist whose general election prospects are viewed skeptically by much of the party leadership. Mr. Biden’s overwhelming victory in South Carolina on Saturday established him as the clear front-runner in the Democrats’ centrist wing, prompting two rivals, Ms. Klobuchar and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., to end their bids and throw their support to Mr. Biden.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As Mr. Sanders, 78, returned to Vermont, where he voted Tuesday morning, his allies acknowledged that they had been caught off guard by the swiftness with which Mr. Biden’s former adversaries had locked arms to oppose Mr. Sanders’s campaign. They argued that Mr. Sanders was still far better equipped — financially and in his campaign organization — than Mr. Biden to compete for the nomination over a long primary race. And they vowed to highlight to voters the sharp differences in their agendas.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With their long tradition of elevating moderate Democrats, Virginia and North Carolina were fertile terrain for Mr. Biden. He got a lift from his triumph in nearby South Carolina, a state many Super Tuesday voters were watching to see whether Mr. Biden could recover from his early struggles, and then won a series of endorsements from party leaders, including many in Virginia.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">His advantage only grew after Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg, who were competing for some of the same voters, withdrew from the race and gave their support to Mr. Biden.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Bloomberg had poured millions of dollars from his personal fortune into TV ads in the two states and made repeated appearances in both, with his advisers holding out the most hope in North Carolina. And while he has been more focused on liberal states, Mr. Sanders made multiple stops in Virginia and North Carolina in the weeks after the New Hampshire primary last month. </p></div><aside class="css-ew4tgv" aria-label="companion column"></aside></div><div></div><div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Democratic campaign barreled into Super Tuesday in a state of extraordinary flux, as a loose alliance of party leaders, elected officials and centrist voting blocs seemed to fall in behind Mr. Biden since his weekend triumph in South Carolina. On Monday night, Mr. Biden made appearances in Texas with three former rivals — Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Buttigieg and former Representative Beto O’Rourke — who are now supporting his candidacy, while Mr. Sanders rallied supporters in Minnesota in an effort to capture Ms. Klobuchar’s home state.</p></div><aside class="css-ew4tgv" aria-label="companion column"></aside></div><div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Few presidential candidates have endured the political roller coaster Mr. Biden has found himself riding in recent weeks. After finishing a distant fourth in Iowa and then coming in fifth in New Hampshire, he was short on money, in danger of losing support to Mr. Bloomberg and facing a do-or-die primary in South Carolina.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yet after <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/us/politics/joe-biden-anita-dunn.html?searchResultPosition=1" title="">shaking up his campaign</a> and installing a longtime adviser, Anita Dunn, as his chief strategist, Mr. Biden was able to claw back into contention by finishing second in Nevada. Then, after two solid debate performances during which his ascendant rivals were the ones under attack, he picked up a crucial endorsement: Representative James E. Clyburn, the highest-ranking African-American in Congress and the most influential South Carolina Democrat, came out for Mr. Biden at an emotional news conference.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With Mr. Clyburn’s imprimatur, Mr. Biden built a considerable advantage with black voters that propelled him to a 28-point rout in South Carolina.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">His big victory immediately prompted what Mr. Biden had been seeking for months: a flood of support from Democratic leaders, donors and his onetime rivals. By Monday night, just 48 hours after what was his first victory over three separate presidential runs, Mr. Biden was at the rally in Dallas, gaining the endorsements of his three former opponents.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Sanders entered the day with a modest delegate advantage and was poised to extend his lead because, having consolidated much of the party’s left, he was better organized and better funded than any of the more moderate candidates.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Having finished at the top of Iowa and New Hampshire with less than 30 percent of the vote, Mr. Sanders extended his lead with a commanding victory in Nevada, where he demonstrated that he could expand his heavily white base to include Hispanic voters.</p></div><aside class="css-ew4tgv" aria-label="companion column"></aside></div><div></div><div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The propulsive energy behind both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders posed a challenge to two other formidable candidates, Ms. Warren and Mr. Bloomberg, who have charted drastically different paths to the final stages of the Democratic race. For Mr. Bloomberg, the Super Tuesday contests were the first time he appeared on a ballot, because he bypassed the February contests entirely.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Bloomberg, the wealthy former mayor of New York City, has been a pervasive presence in the race: He has run more than half a billion dollars in paid advertising since he announced his campaign in November, offering himself to the Democratic establishment as a potential savior if Mr. Biden failed to halt Mr. Sanders in the earliest primaries and caucuses. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yet Mr. Bloomberg’s prospects were uncertain heading into Super Tuesday, after his disastrous performance in a debate last month in Las Vegas and Mr. Biden’s resurgence in the polls. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Bloomberg’s campaign publicly signaled he planned to forge ahead even if he faced a disappointing night, announcing plans to stump later this week in Pennsylvania and Michigan, and holding his election-night event in Florida, which holds a primary in two weeks. But advisers to Mr. Bloomberg have also acknowledged that the former mayor would make a cold assessment of his options once the results of Super Tuesday became known. He is likely to face intense pressure to make way for Mr. Biden if his self-funded candidacy does not yield impressive results.</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Katie Glueck contributed reporting from Oakland, Calif., and Patricia Mazzei from Miami.</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"></p></div><aside class="css-ew4tgv" aria-label="companion column"></aside></div><div></div></section>
