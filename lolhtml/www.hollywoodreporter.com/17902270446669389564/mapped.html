As the company elevates Bob Chapek to the top job amid coronavirus fears and economic turmoil, his predecessor will still hold the creative reins "like a CEO but without the stress."
</h2>
<p>Days after Bob Iger&#39;s Feb. 25 <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-picks-bob-chapek-as-next-ceo-1281130" target="_blank">resignation</a> as CEO of Disney, the surprise move is still stuck in Hollywood&#39;s craw like a piece of gristle. &quot;It was very unusual to come out with an announcement at 4 o&#39;clock [Eastern] the day that Disney was being pounded in the market,&quot; says veteran Wall Street analyst Hal Vogel. &quot;There were recent conference calls with quarterly earnings. You&#39;d think there would have been a hint at least that would have eased the way through this announcement. Instead, when the market is down sharply, all of a sudden he&#39;s resigned.&quot;</p>
<p>The stock price has dropped sharply since then, which may provide hints about the reason for the hurry.</p>
<p>Iger, 69, contended that the move was &quot;only abrupt in other people&#39;s eyes because we haven&#39;t been talking about it publicly.&quot; The Disney board was well aware of his plans, he said, and his successor, Bob Chapek, had been chosen in advance. Analyst Rich Greenfield can see why the storied Disney leader may have been ready to make a move after a &quot;Super Bowl year&quot; in 2019, but he too has questions. &quot;It makes all the sense in the world that Bob would have left sometime in 2020,&quot; Greenfield says. &quot;The only thing that nobody can explain is why it felt so rushed.&quot;</p>
<p>The announcement blindsided top Disney executives, including direct-to-consumer chairman Kevin Mayer, top TV exec Peter Rice and film studio chief Alan Horn. The three learned of the change only a few short hours before the rest of the world. The impact on morale at the highest levels is unknown but seems unlikely to be good. Also worth noting: Having promoted Chapek to CEO, the company named no successor to run theme parks. That would not seem to signal careful planning.</p>
<p>The sense of haste seemed particularly out of character for Iger, who would be expected to design at least the appearance of a smooth, calm transition. Iger is widely known as exceptionally image-conscious and deliberate about presentation. But when he and Chapek were interviewed together on CNBC, a couple of old Disney hands commented (in separate conversations) that the appearance seemed uncharacteristically slapped together. &quot;Bob is always groomed to perfection. He has a very specific on-camera appearance,&quot; says one. &quot;That was not the Bob we saw on CNBC.&quot;</p>
<p>Disney has long been one of the darlings of the corporate world, but it&#39;s also true that the waters are starting to churn, and there is a good argument to be made that Iger just handed Chapek a pretty undesirable job. After a string of lauded acquisitions &mdash; Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm &mdash; Disney seems to be having trouble digesting the $71 billion purchase of Fox. In August, Iger blamed the newly acquired film studio for a $170 million third-quarter loss and said Disney was scrapping most of the movie slate it had acquired. In September, he again cited Fox problems to <em>The New York Times</em>, saying, &quot;I&#39;m convinced that the turnaround can happen. It&#39;s not a snap of your fingers, but it&#39;s not 10 years of lost value. It&#39;s a year and a half.&quot;</p>
<p>That year and a half &mdash; if that&#39;s what it turns out to be &mdash; is packed with other challenges. There are questions about how <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bob-igers-next-priority-streamline-disney-development-1283260" target="_blank">Disney+</a> is progressing in the wake of its impressive launch in November. That&#39;s where the company has put all its marbles, and it has reported a robust 28.6 million subscribers. But building a streaming service is a daunting task. Netflix had no competitors when it started, and it enjoyed lightning-in-a-bottle hits right out of the gate. In 2020, making a bet on streaming means spending big while doing without traditional revenue sources and dealing with a lot of competition.</p>
<p>Maybe what tipped the scale was the coronavirus, which affects film distribution, cruise ships, hotels and theme parks. Disney&#39;s<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/shanghai-disney-resort-shuts-down-as-chinas-coronavirus-outbreak-spreads-1272580" target="_blank"> park closures</a> in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tokyo have cost the company tens of millions of dollars, and in his position, Iger must have a good sense of what is coming globally. Vogel says problems at the parks in the U.S. could be much more damaging to the bottom line as Easter approaches. &quot;We don&#39;t know what will happen yet,&quot; he cautions.</p>
<p>But Greenfield says, &quot;We have to imagine that every employee was worried about what impact the closure of U.S. parks would have on the company&#39;s stock price and finances &mdash; not to mention what happens if movie theaters in the U.S. and globally have to shut down.&quot; So, he wonders, &quot;Did that play into Iger&#39;s thinking in terms of timing? Was that an accelerant to his departure?&quot;</p>
<p>When Iger became CEO in 2005, the stock was at $27 a share. On the day he stepped down as CEO, it was at $126. (In November, it posted its highest-ever close at $152.) On March 9, shares dipped below $105 as the overall market tanked. Iger&#39;s announcement might have seemed hasty, but he locked in an impressive run-up in share price on his watch.</p>
<p>By sticking around as executive chairman, Iger gets to do what is arguably the fun stuff &mdash; working on movies and TV shows. And while he is set to leave the company for good at the end of 2021, Greenfield suggests he could stay in that role for years &mdash; without day-to-day responsibilities &mdash; &quot;like a CEO without the stress.&quot;</p>
