long after I moved to Kelowna, a city in southern British Columbia known for its wineries, water sports and hiking trails, I saw a news story about a monster sighting. Two brothers had seen something undulating across the water in the middle of Okanagan Lake, an 84-mile long lake that curves down the Okanagan Valley past Kelowna in the shape of a serpent. The wave crested and fanned out like a wake, but there wasn&rsquo;t a boat in sight. They were adamant it was Ogopogo.</p><blockquote><p> Ogopogo is to Kelowna what Nessie is to Loch Ness </p></blockquote><p>You can&rsquo;t live in Kelowna for any length of time without hearing about its mysterious lake creature. Ogopogo is to Kelowna what Nessie is to Loch Ness: a yet-to-be-identified cryptid that reputedly resides in the lake&rsquo;s depths and surfaces just often enough to keep the legend alive.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p085g29h\"}}</p><p>It&rsquo;s been described as a multi-humped serpentine beast, with green or black skin and the head of a horse, snake or sheep. Drawings depict a coiling sea dragon like what you might see on an old mariner&rsquo;s map where it says, &ldquo;Here there be monsters.&rdquo; Around town, Ogopogo takes on a benign cartoonish form as a 15-foot-long green- and cream-coloured statue on the waterfront, the smiling mascot for the local WHL hockey team and as plush toys at souvenir shops. Like its palindrome name, its physical appearance &ndash; and very existence &ndash; is something no one can make heads nor tails of.</p><p>Ogopogo mania peaked in the 1980s when the region&rsquo;s tourism association offered a <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/clip/26627242/1986-04-27-ogopogo-myth-or-reality/\" target=\"_blank\">$1m reward</a> for proof of the creature&rsquo;s existence. Greenpeace came forward and named it an endangered species, demanding that Ogopogo be captured only on film, and not in the flesh. American TV shows of the era, including In Search Of and Unsolved Mysteries, even reported on the Okanagan Valley&rsquo;s mysterious inhabitant.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p085g8rl\"}}</p><p>Yet, it wasn&rsquo;t until I attended the <a href=\"https://indigenoustourismconference.com/\" target=\"_blank\">International Indigenous Tourism Conference</a> in Kelowna last autumn that I realised the Ogopogo of Canadian popular culture &ndash; a creature that 16% of British Columbians believe in &ndash; only came about through miscommunication between Canada&rsquo;s early European settlers and the Okanagan Valley&rsquo;s original inhabitants, the Okanagan/syilx.</p><blockquote><p> It&rsquo;s not really a monster, it&rsquo;s a spirit of the lake and it protects this valley from one end to the other </p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not really a monster, it&rsquo;s a spirit of the lake and it protects this valley from one end to the other,&rdquo; said Pat Raphael of the Westbank First Nation, a member nation of the larger Okanagan/syilx Nation Alliance, who guided me through the syilx&rsquo;s ancestral lands bordering Okanagan Lake. As our bus drove south along the water, she explained that while many in Canada know the creature as Ogopogo, to the syilx, it&rsquo;s <em>n ̓x̌ax̌aitkʷ</em> (n-ha-ha-it-koo), which means &ldquo;the sacred spirit of the lake.&rdquo; Raphael pointed out the brown hump of Rattlesnake Island across the water, where the spirit is said to dwell. She also had us practice saying n ̓x̌ax̌aitkʷ in nsyilxcən, the syilx language.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not Ogopogo! What are you, colonised?&rdquo; she joked when a few of us struggled with the pronunciation and reverted to saying Ogopogo.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p085g9mw\"}}</p><p>Before European fur traders arrived in the valley in 1809, the syilx had been living in the area for at least 12,000 years. They had their own laws, justice system and beliefs. Chief among them was the importance of water, represented by n ̓x̌ax̌aitkʷ. It existed in two forms: a spiritual form and a physical, tangible form, which was embodied by the lake itself. Sometimes, though, the spirit would reveal itself from within the lake.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;In our stories, [n ̓x̌ax̌aitkʷ is] actually very dark in colour and it&rsquo;s got the head of a horse and the antlers of a deer,&rdquo; said Coralee Miller, assistant manager at the new <a href=\"https://www.sncewips.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sncəwips Heritage Museum</a> in West Kelowna. &ldquo;Missionaries saw our water spirit and the habit was to demonise our spiritual beliefs.&rdquo;</p><p>The syilx fed n ̓x̌ax̌aitkʷ symbolically, with tobacco and sage, and occasionally an offering of Kokanee salmon to thank the lake for providing food and water. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I think that misunderstanding came from &ndash; settlers saw us throw a little bit of meat in the water,&rdquo; Miller explained.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p085g9ws\"}}</p><p>Pioneers were soon telling stories of a serpent in Okanagan Lake that needed a live animal sacrifice to appease it and ensure a safe passage across the water. Once the idea of a bloodthirsty lake serpent took hold, it grew out of control &ndash; settlers began patrolling the lake with guns because they were nervous the beast would attack.</p><p>But by the 1920s (and likely in the absence of any actual human predation), cooler heads prevailed. Tourism officials named the creature Ogopogo after a catchy English folk song, whose lyrics included: &ldquo;His mother was an earwig; his father was a whale; a little bit of head; and hardly any tail; and Ogopogo was his name.&rdquo; N ̓x̌ax̌aitkʷ had transformed from a revered spirit into a cartoon-like creature that would lure tourists.</p><blockquote><p> Over time, Ogopogo is what made Kelowna a household name in Canada </p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s hard to know just how many people have travelled to Kelowna over the last century in the hope of seeing the mythical lake monster, but over time, Ogopogo is what made Kelowna a household name in Canada. For years, the creature appeared on Kelowna&rsquo;s parade float, both in town and at larger parades in the Pacific Northwest and Alberta. Gift shops hawked gimmick jars of Ogopogo&rsquo;s &ldquo;eggs&rdquo; and even its &ldquo;feces&rdquo; that would fly off shelves. While the tourism office no longer actively promotes Ogopogo today, the legend remains as popular as ever.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p085gb10\"}}</p><p>Yet, the misappropriation and commodification of n ̓x̌ax̌aitkʷ is a sensitive issue. To Miller, a member of the Westbank First Nation, n ̓x̌ax̌aitkʷ and Ogopogo are two separate entities and shouldn&rsquo;t be conflated. One of the museum&rsquo;s missions is to tell the story of the area&rsquo;s Indigenous people, and talk about the importance of n ̓x̌ax̌aitkʷ in protecting the lake. It&rsquo;s part of what she calls &ldquo;de-programming;&rdquo; questioning or deconstructing the colonial perspective on local history and culture. This is also an important step towards reconciliation, an ongoing, countrywide process of establishing and maintaining respectful relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Canadians.</p><p><strong>You may also be interested in:</strong><br /> &bull; <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20200210-canadas-little-known-geological-wonder\" target=\"_blank\">Canada's little-known geological wonder</a><br /> &bull; <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20200121-the-birthplace-of-canadas-mountain-culture\" target=\"_blank\">The birthplace of Canada's mountain culture</a><br /> &bull; <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20191215-the-little-known-us-canada-border-war\" target=\"_blank\">The little-known US-Canada border war</a></p><p>This spring, Indigenous tour company <a href=\"https://www.moccasintrails.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Moccasin Trails</a> is launching paddling tours on Okanagan Lake where guides will discuss n ̓x̌ax̌aitkʷ as a spiritual talisman &ndash; not a physical lake monster &ndash; and explain how it became appropriated.</p><blockquote><p> We want people to leave our experiences with a better understanding of Indigenous culture </p></blockquote><p>The canoe journeys begin with a feeding of the water ceremony. As the canoe glides across the lake&rsquo;s glassy surface, a syilx cultural leader scatters sage and tobacco in the water while summoning the spirit world and telling his ancestors to keep everyone safe. Moccasin Trails co-owner Greg Hopf says the ceremony is powerful, and meant to illustrate the connection Indigenous people have with the earth, which is highly personal.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of what each person interprets the spirit to be,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We want people to leave our experiences with a better understanding of Indigenous culture.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p085gb28\"}}</p><p>In downtown Kelowna, the <a href=\"https://www.kelownamuseums.ca/museums/the-okanagan-heritage-museum/\" target=\"_blank\">Okanagan Heritage Museum</a> works with the Westbank First Nation to tell a more thorough story of the region&rsquo;s history. It redid its entire gallery in 2019 and represents syilx as a living culture, rather than focusing solely on the people&rsquo;s way of life pre-colonisation. According to Kelowna Museums&rsquo; executive director, Linda Digby, sylix knowledge and perspective is now woven into every era depicted in the museum, and a display on Ogopogo explains how n ̓x̌ax̌aitkʷ was misunderstood by settlers and grew into a tourism boon.</p><p>&ldquo;To settlers [Ogopogo] was a real thing,&rdquo; said Digby. &ldquo;They definitely misinterpreted what they heard from the Indigenous community and had no qualms about making up their own stories and appropriating from them, and it wouldn&rsquo;t have even occurred to them they were doing that.&rdquo;</p><p>As time wore on, the settlers&rsquo; inventory of stories grew &ndash; their neighbour saw the creature, or they themselves saw something strange in the lake. &ldquo;You live here long enough everyone&rsquo;s going to see something,&rdquo; Digby said.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p085gb7p\"}}</p><p>During my quest to understand n ̓x̌ax̌aitkʷ, I encountered a few people who are true believers based on what they&rsquo;ve seen in Okanagan Lake. And they are far from alone: the museum&rsquo;s archives are filled with newspaper clippings of Ogopogo sightings over the decades, along with stories about how a lake monster is good for the city&rsquo;s bottom line.</p><p>&ldquo;Ogopogo is great for tourism. It adds colour and panache and atmosphere,&rdquo; said Robert Young, a University of British Columbia Okanagan earth sciences professor who is often called on as a voice of reason when an Ogopogo sighting occurs or new &ldquo;footage&rdquo; surfaces.</p><p>For Young, Ogopogo isn&rsquo;t a question in biology, it&rsquo;s a question in earth science processes &ndash; the way water moves over the surface of the earth. Thermal stratification in a lake can cause a wave to appear from nowhere when a denser layer of water slides beneath a more buoyant layer, as often happens in the spring or autumn, he explained. He calls it an &ldquo;Ogopogo wave&rdquo;.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p085gbck\"}}</p><p>This theory offers a plausible explanation for what people might be seeing on the water. But while Young is all for critical thinking about Ogopogo, he&rsquo;s also loathe to disprove its existence. It should persist, he says, saying that Ogopogo is a Canadian cultural icon, and n ̓x̌ax̌aitkʷ is an important part of syilx beliefs.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t worry a lake creature will nibble my toes when I go for a dip, but the power of nature gives me pause. I&rsquo;ve started many days with a morning walk that leads to a ridge ringed by mountains overlooking Okanagan Lake and the rounded hills and extinct volcanoes of the Thompson Plateau behind it. I&rsquo;m in awe I live in such a stunning place. When the wind ripples the water and sways the ponderosa pine trees growing on the hillside, I feel a connection to the natural beauty of my home.

She&rsquo;s seen how the hue and length of the coloured sand fluctuates with the currents and the seasons. So, on that afternoon, knowing that next year it may not appear in the same illuminating fashion, or at all, LaFaver and her family seized their opportunity.</p><p>&ldquo;We got off the boat and hung out there the whole day,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know when I would get to see it that distinct along the whole shore [again].&rdquo;</p><p>Known simply as &ldquo;Purple Sands Beach&rdquo;, this secluded expanse of land has earned a reputation around Canada for its awe-inspiring geological feature. The grains of sand can appear in a spectrum of chromatic hues, ranging from lavender to magenta and sometimes even pink. Vivid particles can appear smeared down the shore like an artist&rsquo;s brushstroke, scattered in clusters across rocks and rippled beneath the water&rsquo;s surface in the lake&rsquo;s shallow bays.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p082k06z\"}}</p><p>Seeing this natural phenomenon in person has become a pilgrimage for naturalists, geological fanatics and out-of-town visitors, who arrive year-round with hopes of catching a glimpse before it's&nbsp;washed away or disappears underneath snowfall.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s real,&rdquo; said Debbie Hunter, 64, a Candle Lake local who lives near Minowukaw Beach, one of the park&rsquo;s designated campgrounds.</p><blockquote><p> It&rsquo;s hard to believe that there&rsquo;s purple sand. It&rsquo;s just &ndash; it&rsquo;s bizarre, really. </p></blockquote><p>After a strong windstorm or an occurrence of large wave breaks, Hunter has seen traces of the purple sand displaced all around this landscape that shares a border with provincial forestland. Some residents have even reported seeing the coloured grains along the shores of Torch Lake, a smaller body of water that feeds into Candle Lake, but not in the same copious amount or vibrancy.</p><p>Wherever it is, Hunter said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s hard to believe that there&rsquo;s purple sand. It&rsquo;s just &ndash; it&rsquo;s bizarre, really.&rdquo;</p><p>While the imagery of purple sand may appear like something from a fairy tale, there is a geological explanation behind it. According to Kevin Ansdell, professor of geology at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, all beaches attribute their colouring to the minerals, rocks and shells that comprise their various sand particles.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p082k074\"}}</p><p>&ldquo;If you go around the world, there&rsquo;s all sorts of different coloured beaches,&rdquo; explained Ansdell, whose work includes public outreach and education about the diversity of geological landscapes within Saskatchewan. &ldquo;Obviously, the most common are the typical white sands that you think about. Those are typically made of lots of rounded grains of quartz.&rdquo;</p><p>As the second-most common mineral found on Earth, quartz is the reason why so many shorelines have white sand, he said.</p><p>However, white is not the only hue to decorate a coastline. Iceland and Hawaii, for example, each have a collection of black-sand beaches, which owe their dark and moody tones to volcanic lava rock. And there are other examples around the world where minerals and sediment have transformed bodies of water into surreal-looking landscapes. Peyto Lake in <a href=\"https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/ab/banff\" target=\"_blank\">Banff National Park</a> in Alberta owes its turquoise colour to glacial sediments suspended in its water; while the Yellow River in western China, which originates in the province of Qinghai, has accumulated so much silt and sediment that the river remains a constant shade of blonde.</p><p>The environment of northern Saskatchewan, however, owes its colouring to a mineral that has been discovered all around the world but is found in large quantities across northern Canada. &ldquo;With the purple-sand beaches, of which Candle Lake is one example,&rdquo; Ansdell said, &ldquo;the most likely mineral is the mineral called garnet.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p082k075\"}}</p><p>For thousands of years, this colourful and resistant mineral, one that comes in a variety of shades but which is mostly seen as dark red, has been discovered in rocks across the Canadian Shield, a large section of the North American continent that encompasses a majority of the northern half of Canada. This mineral-rich landmass extends from Labrador in the east to Manitoba in the west and all the way north into the Northwest Territories, including most of northern Saskatchewan. Because of this landscape&rsquo;s vast size and ancient history, the resources found in the Canadian Shield have become valuable components of the nation&rsquo;s economy.</p><p>&ldquo;In the Canadian Shield overall, there&rsquo;s lots of different mineral deposits,&rdquo; said Ansdell, of the gold, copper, nickel and even diamonds that are often uncovered, in addition to minerals like garnet.</p><p>Found inside rocks that date back more than a billion years, garnet is created during metamorphism, a chemical and mineralogical process that happens when rocks become buried deep inside the Earth&rsquo;s crust as its tectonic plates shift. Through various processes, these rocks change their internal compositions to adjust to higher pressures and temperatures, Ansdell explained.</p><p>&ldquo;Obviously if you&rsquo;ve got garnet in the sands, the garnet must have come from somewhere,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost certainly the metamorphosed rocks in northern Saskatchewan.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p082k05g\"}}</p><p>These rocks were then transported across the province during the most recent Ice Age, which ended approximately 12,000 years ago, when large sheets of ice slid across exposed sections of the Canadian Shield, scattering their contents in places like Candle Lake. Over time, the rocks were broken down and carried downstream by fresh water sources, reworked by the currents and eventually collected in one place, said Ansdell.</p><p>While the residents of Candle Lake may not know all the scientific details about how its most famous beach receives its alluring sparkle, they do remember how it felt when they saw it for the first time.</p><p>&ldquo;I was a just kid, probably just 14,&rdquo; recalled Hunter, about her first encounter with the purple sand more than 50 years ago. Hunter grew up in the nearby city of Prince Albert and began visiting the lake before there was a paved highway. &ldquo;If you had rain or any miserable weather&hellip; yikes,&rdquo; she joked, about making the 80km journey to visit her husband&rsquo;s family who owned a cabin in the Candle Lake community.</p><blockquote><p> It&rsquo;s a small-knit community and they seem to look out after each other </p></blockquote><p>Back then, mostly avid fisherman and hunters were drawn to the lake&rsquo;s clear water that is home to many fish species, including the walleye, pike, perch, burbot, whitefish and sucker, and its abundant wildlife, like elk, bear, wolves and deer. After a new highway was constructed in the mid-1970s, which connected this distant village to the rest of the province, word spread and Candle Lake quickly became a year-round destination.</p><p>In 1986, the government of Canada established it as a provincial park, to &ldquo;protect the fringe of the northern forest and to offer a variety of recreational opportunities in all seasons.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p082k07q\"}}</p><p>Like many environments in the upper reaches of the northern hemisphere, Candle Lake is one of extremes. During the winter months, its glassy surface transforms into a barren ice field. Pickup trucks and ice shacks dot the horizon and provide shelter for the brave fishermen who, even when temperatures drop to -30C, drill holes into this dense, icy covering to catch their dinner. Locals stay active by playing in the town&rsquo;s curling league and shovel snow for their neighbours who may need extra help, said Hunter, who serves as a volunteer fire fighter and first responder.</p><p>&ldquo;The people are so friendly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a small-knit community and they seem to look out after each other.&rdquo;</p><p>By late April, longer days and warmer temperatures help the lake thaw out, and by July, families start to arrive by the carload to celebrate Canada Day, the busiest time of year, when close to 15,000 visitors pack the shoreline to celebrate the national holiday.</p><p>No matter what time of the year it is, Purple Sands Beach and the beauty of this rugged landscape attracts people from around the world, and some of its biggest admirers plan to stay for a while.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done a lot of travelling, but work has kept me here and I&rsquo;m very content with that,&rdquo; said LaFaver. &ldquo;[Candle Lake] is a beautiful place to work and live.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><em>CORRECTION</em></strong><em>: A previous version of this story referred to tides impacting the hue and amount of purple sand.

But it has its own unique claim to fame: it&rsquo;s the gateway to Rogers Pass, home to some of the best backcountry skiing in Canada, which is why I was here with my crew of skiers to access big mountain-style alpine lines in the Selkirk range. And it&rsquo;s also home to the origin story of Western Canada&rsquo;s celebrated mountain culture, which has drawn in countless mountaineers, climbers and skiers just like us for more than a century.</p><p>As we pulled out of town to head west on the Trans-Canada Highway and wound up towards the summit of the pass, I glanced to the right, my attention caught by what looked to be a European chalet almost completely hidden in trees on the steep hillside. Its antique gingerbread facade, with steeply gabled, narrow two-storey roofs and ornate framework hanging from the eves, seemed anachronous in this blue-collar town dominated by rail and sawmill, where nearly all historic buildings were consumed in a fierce fire in 1926.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p080dd73\"}}</p><p>That curious house is one of eight that make up a little village called Edelweiss. In this nearly forgotten cluster of homes, on the fringe of this low-profile town, lived a group of Swiss guides who left an indelible mark on this part of the world. They put up numerous first ascents in Rogers Pass and around Banff and Lake Louise and unlocked these peaks for a new wave of adventurers looking for unclimbed mountains after Europe&rsquo;s had been conquered. And they laid the foundation for skiing as the winter obsession it is today in this region.</p><p>The chalet disappeared from the rear-view mirror as we drove up the highway that parallels the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) track, and it was immediately apparent why this formidable spine of untouched mountains presented CPR&rsquo;s final hurdle in connecting the east and west of the country. Where progress had been swift from the coast and across the prairies, the seemingly impenetrable Selkirk Mountains between Golden and Revelstoke slowed building while surveyors searched for a pass and engineered the rail over its sharp landscape. In fact, the grade is so steep here that, due to the limitations in train locomotion in the late 1800s, it wasn&rsquo;t feasible to haul dining cars &ndash; which had become a popular feature of rail travel &ndash; up the pass for the long journey between Banff and Golden to Revelstoke and onto Vancouver.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p080dd0b\"}}</p><p>As a solution, CPR built Glacier House, an alpine chalet close to the summit of the pass, where passengers could get off the train for meals and stay overnight if they chose. This was the latest iteration in CPR president William Van Horne&rsquo;s vision of the railway as a vehicle to bring wealthy tourists to experience the romantic lifestyle of the mountains. CPR had already played a significant role in the development of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/glac/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Glacier</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/bc/yoho\" target=\"_blank\">Yoho National Parks,</a> and built grand hotels in Banff and Lake Louise. But, concerned that guests would wander off and become lost (or worse) in these serrated peaks and crevassed glaciers so close to Glacier House &ndash; and the negative press that might ensure &ndash; CPR hired Swiss mountain guides, known as the best in the world for their depth of skill and breadth of knowledge, to stay at the chalet and guide its guests through these undiscovered mountains. This move was the advent of adventure tourism in Western Canada.</p><p><strong>You may also be interested in:</strong><br /> &bull; <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20180621-the-unlikely-home-of-the-worlds-smallest-desert\" target=\"_blank\">The unlikely home of the world's smallest desert</a><br /> &bull; <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20180418-tuktoyaktuk-canadas-last-arctic-village\" target=\"_blank\">Canada's last Arctic village?</a><br /> &bull; <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20191215-the-little-known-us-canada-border-war\" target=\"_blank\">The little-known Canada-US border war</a></p><p>First up were Edouard Feuz Sr and Christian Haesler, brought by CPR from Interlaken in 1899. Seven more guides joined them, including Edouard&rsquo;s brothers Walter and Ernest, who initially came to Canada each spring and returned to Switzerland in October. Each season, CPR worried that the guides, whom the railway relied on to help lure tourists, might not come back to Canada. So they built Edelweiss in 1912 for the guides to bring their families and stay permanently in the country.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p080dcyp\"}}</p><p>The Swiss Village became a tourist attraction of its own, with a Disneyland-like sign at the base of the hill, visible from the passing train, announcing the presence of mountaineering greatness and the potential for hopeful climbers to leverage such accomplished guidance. The Swiss guides became well-known for guiding many tourists, aspiring climbers and serious climbers in the Selkirks. As much as CPR&rsquo;s original mission was to provide the first transportation route to connect the young country, CPR&rsquo;s marketing mission was to sell this part of Canada as unblemished country ripe for the adventurous to explore &ndash; and the Swiss guides were the lynchpin in this strategy. As Arthur Wheeler wrote in the <em>Canadian Alpine Journal</em> in 1928, &ldquo;The coming of the Swiss guides created a new era. Climbing became more general, and not confined only to mountaineers of repute in alpine circles and mountain clubs.&rdquo;</p><p>Parking at the highway&rsquo;s zenith, we headed into the <a href=\"https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/bc/glacier/visit/heures-hours\" target=\"_blank\">Rogers Pass Discovery Center</a>, where staff directed us to the Swiss Guides room to don ski boots, examine maps and routes and read the avalanche report. It was like walking back in time. Glacier House no longer exists &ndash; pieces of its foundation still remain down by the Illecillewaet Campground in a ghost of its former glory &ndash; but a glimpse of its grand heyday has been preserved in antiques, recovered from the chalet, here in this room. Among the plush chairs, stone fireplace fronts, gold mantles and timber bar, with the sawtooth massif of the Hermit and Tupper mountains rising out the window, it was easy to imagine the train pulling up to Glacier Station and seeing Ernest Feuz brandishing climbing gear, waving from his post on the platform in what became a familiar sight for travellers on the CPR.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p080dcyt\"}}</p><p>Old signs from the chalet hung from the post across the timber bar. One advertised &ldquo;The Challenge of the Mountains&rdquo;, complete with rentals of ponies and divided skirts for women to ride them. The journeys on offer from Glacier House for adventure seekers &ndash; Great Glacier for $1, Asulkan Glacier for $2, Baloo Pass via Cougar Valley for $5 &ndash; echoed some of the routes on our Rogers Pass ski touring maps. But it was the text at the bottom of this sign that caught my eye: &ldquo;Swiss Guides are stationed at the hotel and are available for the service of tourists for the fee of $5 per day. The guides provide rope, ice axes, etc and visitors intending to climb should be equipped with stout boots, well-nailed.&rdquo;</p><p>The Swiss guides, renowned for their training in snow, rock, ice, weather, maps and first aid and rescue, established nearly all the first ascents of the peaks that we were now skiing among: Uto, Mt Sir Donald, Eagle, Avalanche, McGill, Ursus, MacDonald, Tupper and many more. They scoped and climbed each route, as well as trails and campsites on the way in, before guiding clients on it &ndash; but then offered the claim of first ascent to their guests in the humble tradition of mountain guiding.</p><blockquote><p> It seems almost incredible that he is in mountain climbing circles a world-famous person </p></blockquote><p>Each guide notched more than 20 true first ascents to his name, though, with Ernest achieving a stunning 102. Upon Ernest&rsquo;s death in 1952, then a fixture in the Golden community, as were the rest of the guides and their families, the local newspaper, Golden Star, called him a shockingly humble expert among experts: &ldquo;Knowing Ernest as we do, as a very modest man, it seems almost incredible that he is in mountain climbing circles a world-famous person.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p080dcys\"}}</p><p>Back in Golden, my ski gear clammy from a long day of touring the pass, I sought out the <a href=\"https://www.goldenbcmuseum.com/museum.html\" target=\"_blank\">Golden Museum</a> to learn more about the guides. Inside the Quonset hut-style building, past the early First Nations exhibits, an alcove displayed antiquated climbing gear and grainy photos of men draped in ropes and standing on improbable perches in vast landscapes. Their guides, though, were conspicuously absent. It sparked my need for tangible stories about these people, for the beating heart of this legacy.</p><p>Which is how I found Rudi Gertsch. Known around the region as the godfather of heli-skiing, he founded <a href=\"https://purcellheliskiing.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Purcell Heliskiing</a> in 1974 as the next generation of Swiss guides to put down roots and exert undeniable influence here, and was the first to bring ski tourists to Golden. Before this, Gertsch said, locals had a little ski hill at the Swiss village and another ski hill that they shared with the Swedes in the Blaeberry, a neighbourhood north of town. There were no lifts; people had to walk up the slope on snowshoes carrying their skis. The first lifts in Golden weren&rsquo;t installed until 1986 on Whitetooth Ski Hill.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p080dd02\"}}</p><p>Gertsch grew up in a mountain-guiding family in Switzerland; his father had considered coming out to Golden after World War One, when CPR was looking for younger guides to join the first generation. &ldquo;My dad was quite interested &ndash; it&rsquo;s always interesting for any guide where he can still do some first ascents and new climbs somewhere that&rsquo;s not overdeveloped &ndash; but he decided not to,&rdquo; recalled Gertsch in a Swiss accent that&rsquo;s been tempered by more than 50 years in Canada. &ldquo;We talked about Canada and Golden since I was a kid. I was brought up with the idea of it. Then 30 years later, I ended up here.&rdquo;</p><p>He&rsquo;d planned to stay for a year, but his timing was lucky: heli-skiing was just getting started, and this modern access to the deeper parts of Canada&rsquo;s untamed landscape again presented a fresh frontier. &ldquo;It was so new and challenging, figuring out how to do this and being out in the mountains with no one around.&rdquo;</p><p>Gertsch knew some of the old guides well; Walter and Edouard were still alive when he came out in 1966. &ldquo;They were like grandfathers, they were very happy to see the next generation of guides coming in,&rdquo; he said. They told him the stories of the early days, including the harsh realities concealed by the shroud of mountaineering glory.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p080dd08\"}}</p><p>CPR had told the guides they&rsquo;d have houses if they brought their families to Canada; but the architect of Edelweiss knew nothing about Swiss design: the chalets lacked insulation; they were built on a hillside that made gardening impossible; and were located outside town and across the tracks. Only a few months of the year were spent guiding; the rest of the time CPR had them shovelling snow off the chalets in Banff, Lake Louise and Rogers Pass, away from their families, for a pittance.</p><blockquote><p> CPR knew that once they were here with their families, there was no way they could afford to go back </p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;The First [World] War followed by the Depression followed by the Second [World] War was a tough time for everyone, and they were dealing with a railroad that was more interested in making money for themselves than giving guides a decent wage,&rdquo; Gertsch said. &ldquo;CPR knew that once they were here with their families, there was no way they could afford to go back. And they never did.&rdquo;</p><p>Gertsch passed many hours with Eduoard, the elderly guide regaling him with tales of the days when the glaciers spread all the way down to the railway. &ldquo;We always had the highest respect for [the first Swiss guides]. They did some remarkable climbs in those days with nail boots, it&rsquo;s amazing how they got up there. And in all the years they never had a single accident,&rdquo; Gertsch marvelled. &ldquo;They were treating the mountains with a lot of respect. In those days, there was no Search and Rescue, no radios, if something went wrong, they&rsquo;d be out there by themselves.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p080dd74\"}}</p><p>Before I left Golden, I drove across the tracks and up the icy dirt road at the edge of town to get a better look at the Swiss Village. The houses were mostly boarded up, but they were in good condition, even though no one&rsquo;s lived here in years. I passed a man walking his hounds, who greeted me when I parked my truck. He introduced himself as Ken Hamilton, the owner of the village and its surrounding land. He told me that his wife Maryanne is Walter Feuz&rsquo;s granddaughter. They lived in the Swiss Village up until five or six years ago, he said, and still come up almost daily to check on things. They plan to finish restoring the houses and rent them out. They&rsquo;ll be temporary homes for all the skiers and climbers who come to adventure around here, drawn by the same lure of the unbridled Selkirks that&rsquo;s persisted through more than 100 years.</p><p>It seems fitting that they&rsquo;ll stay in the homes of the first men to open those mountains, following their routes, paths and enduring footsteps.</p><p><em>Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCTravel/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a><em>, or follow us on&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Travel\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a><em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbc_travel/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a><em>.</em></p><p><em>If you liked this story,&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/?ocid=ear.bbc.email.we.email-signup\" target=\"_blank\">sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter</a><em>&nbsp;called \"The Essential List\".

At some point as we sailed through the waves, we left Canadian waters and entered the US. But really, the only way we knew we&rsquo;d travelled from one country to the next is that our electronics jumped back an hour to Alaska Standard Time after we passed a Canadian Fisheries patrol boat on the lookout for border violators.</p><p>In fact, the actual line where we crossed from one country to the next has long been under dispute. Even before European contact with the nearby indigenous peoples, the Haida, Tlingit and Tsimshian occasionally warred over the land and sea boundaries in this abundant territory. These days, this boundary disagreement continues between new adversaries and the treasure at the heart of this dispute has evolved from furs and gold to salmon.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07xt7qn\"}}</p><p>Though the US and Canada have the longest undefended border in the world, Dixon Entrance is one of four long-running border disputes between the friendly neighbours. The roots of the quarrel date back to the 18th Century; a time when the colonising stakeholders in the Alaskan Panhandle region (the narrow strip of mountains, fjords and channel islands bordering modern British Columbia) were England and Russia, followed by the US.</p><p><strong>You may also be interested in:</strong><br /> &bull;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20191201-a-us-town-only-reached-through-canada\">A US town only reached through Canada</a><br /> &bull;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/gallery/20170927-canadas-tiny-disputed-island\">Canada&rsquo;s tiny disputed island</a><br /> &bull;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20170824-the-us-land-lost-in-canada\">The US land lost in Canada</a></p><p>When the Russian fleet arrived in Alaska in 1732, they discovered that the area was rich with sea otters and set up a fur trade with the local indigenous people. By the 1760s, Captain James Cook had arrived and began mapping and surveying the North Pacific for the English. Then in the early 1800s, American explorers Meriweather Lewis and William Clark found their way to the Pacific Northwest.</p><blockquote><p> Dixon Entrance is one of four long-running border disputes between the friendly neighbours </p></blockquote><p>This set the stage for a territorial dispute. The local indigenous population was soon overpowered by illness and wars, and throughout the period of Russian colonisation, the southern and eastern borders of the Alaskan Panhandle were never firmly established. The 1825 Treaty of Saint Petersburg between England and Russia set the southern coastal border of the Panhandle near modern Prince Rupert, British Columbia &ndash; but the region was so mountainous that much of it remained unsurveyed. In 1867, the United States bought Alaska from Russia. A few years later, British Columbia joined Canada. Ottawa suggested to Washington, DC, that it was time for an official survey of the Panhandle so the two countries could agree on the border, but the US considered the effort too costly for such a remote piece of land.</p><p>But then gold was discovered; first in British Columbia and then in 1897 in the Klondike in Canada&rsquo;s north-western Yukon territory. An estimated 100,000 prospectors migrated to the area, and it turned out that one of the easiest ways to reach the gold fields was to travel by sea through Dixon Entrance, into the fjords and then inland across the Panhandle. Canada wanted unimpeded travel to their territory, but the US wasn&rsquo;t prepared to give up any of the land they&rsquo;d recently considered too insignificant to map. The countries tried to come to a resolution, but by 1899, they&rsquo;d reached a stalemate.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07xt7n4\"}}</p><p>An international tribunal was formed in 1903 to solve the Alaska Boundary Dispute. Made up of six impartial jurists from the US, Canada and England, the group ended up setting Alaska&rsquo;s eastern boundary 56km east of where the ocean touched the mainland coast. The southern boundary, known as the A-B line, extends from Cape Muzon, the southern-most point of Alaska&rsquo;s Dall Island, straight east through Dixon Entrance to Portland Channel, where it wobbles around a few islands before heading up Portland Canal and into the Coast Mountains.</p><p>Canada was outraged by aspects of the decision, but another issue soon arose. As far as Canada was concerned, the A-B line was the dividing line between the nations; on land and at sea. But the US had a different opinion; they declared that the decision only pertained to the land border, and that according to maritime law, the sea boundary was actually 20km south of the line, halfway across Dixon Entrance. &nbsp;This disagreement continues today.</p><p>These days, about 1.5 million people sail across the contested border each year. Comfortably taking in the region&rsquo;s soaring mountains and ruggedly picturesque islands from the decks of cruise ships, ferries and sailboats, most people are unaware of the border&rsquo;s disputed status.</p><p>It may seem odd that two close allies still can&rsquo;t compromise over the ownership of this narrow, 80km-wide and 50km-long passageway for the sake of easier international relations. But there&rsquo;s a good reason: the Pacific salmon run.</p><p>The salmon&rsquo;s abundant numbers and annual journey have made fishing a key industry in the Pacific Northwest&rsquo;s economy. From the 1880s to 1950s <a href=\"https://www.bcmag.ca/get-caught-up-in-the-story-of-bc-canneries/\">more than 100 canneries and fishing villages</a> sprang up throughout British Columbia, and in recent years, wild salmon from the province has been exported to 53 different countries. In this aquatic gold rush, Dixon Entrance is the jackpot: Through it flow five species; sockeye, coho, chinook, chum and pink, each returning from the ocean intent on reaching their specific home river in Alaska, British Columbia, Washington or Oregon where they spawn and die.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07xt7rv\"}}</p><p>There to meet the salmon each year on their journeys home are two sets of boats following two sets of laws. With no mutually agreed-upon border, fishermen from both countries try to catch their share of the salmon from the disputed waters. The ongoing clash results in a slow, simmering battle that occasionally boils over &ndash; such as during the so-called &ldquo;salmon wars&rdquo; that pit Canadian and Alaskan fishermen against one another during the 1990s.</p><p>Ever since the 1930s, the US and Canada have tried to determine who &ldquo;owns&rdquo; which salmon. This is both an exact and opaque concept: because each salmon is returning not just to a specific river, but to a precise place on the river, unregulated fishing has caused some salmon runs to become locally extinct; in some cases destroying the indigenous food fishery.</p><p>It took 15 years, but the <a href=\"https://www.psc.org/about-us/history-purpose/pacific-salmon-treaty/\">Pacific Salmon Treaty</a>, whose goal was to ensure that fishermen from both countries had access to a fair share of spawning salmon in designated rivers along the Pacific Coast, was finally signed in 1985. Yet, when portions of the treaty expired in 1992, a six-year-long international incident began with both Canada and the US occasionally arresting each others' commercial fishing boats. Tensions escalated when a few hundred Canadian fishermen eventually <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/12/us/salmon-war-in-northwest-spurs-wish-for-good-fences.html\">blockaded</a> an Alaska State ferry in Prince Rupert for three days in 1997 and effectively took its passengers hostage.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07xt7kr\"}}</p><p>A new 10-year agreement that increased scientific management and indigenous fishing rights was signed in 1999 and eased the conflict, but it didn&rsquo;t solve the border dispute. Instead, the stalemate quietly continued. Normally, Canada and the US each police their own fishermen in the disputed waters, but occasionally minor skirmishes arise when Canadian fishermen encounter Alaskan boats fishing in the disputed waters and call a <a href=\"https://notices.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fns-sap/index-eng.cfm?pg=view_notice&amp;DOC_ID=197727&amp;ID=all\">24-hour hotline</a> that&rsquo;s specifically set up for salmon-related violations. By passing along the GPS coordinates and photos of the violating boats, they&rsquo;re able to file a complaint with Canada&rsquo;s Department of Fisheries and Oceans. Since more violations tend to occur by American vessels than Canadian boats, the US hasn&rsquo;t needed to set up such a hotline yet.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Canada, a movement highlighting the rights and needs of indigenous people has made the indigenous food fishery a priority. So, when part of the Pacific Salmon Treaty expires on 31 December 2019, the expected diminished salmon stocks may again disrupt the uneasy border truce.</p><p>Standing at the edge of the Adam&rsquo;s River last November, almost 1,500km south-east (as the fish swims) from Dixon Entrance, Tanner Francois, of Secwepemc Nation was singing a salmon song, thanking the fish for making the long perilous journey back to their spawning grounds. In local lore, there are stories of rivers running so thick and red with sockeye salmon, that you could walk across their backs and reach the other side with dry feet. But on this chilly morning, just a few fishermen were left on the river casting for the last of the season&rsquo;s run.</p><blockquote><p> Without salmon we would not be </p></blockquote><p>The annual migration through Dixon Entrance that sends salmon into <a href=\"https://www.bcsalmon.ca/where-we-fish\">rivers flowing through much of British Columbia</a> has earned the salmon a central place in the minds of the First Nations&rsquo; people, and in the psyche of many British Columbians. Making a roundtrip journey of up to 4,000km from rivers and headwaters, out the sea and then back, the salmon feeds not just <a href=\"https://www.bcsalmon.ca/markets-value\">the economy</a>, but orcas, bears and eagles that rely on the rivers. And they, in turn, feed the forest.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07xt7qp\"}}</p><p>&ldquo;Without salmon we would not be,&rdquo; Francois explains.</p><p>So people on the coast clean and clear creeks and rivers to protect the salmon grounds. School kids get lessons at their local salmon hatcheries and set the newly hatched fry free in the rivers each spring. The indigenous people sing the salmon home through rivers and across mountain ranges. And the fishermen of Dixon Entrance guard their section of the ocean carefully, always on the lookout for border violations, ready to call a 1-800 phone number to settle a diplomatic dispute.</p><p>Meanwhile, the salmon swim under it all &ndash; oblivious to the politics of borders and boundaries. Above the waves, the cruise ship and ferry passengers are just largely oblivious as well. They marvel at the landscape and life; the snow-capped peaks, the green velvet mountains that reach for the sky, the waterfalls, sea otters, orcas, seabirds and bears &ndash; unaware that it&rsquo;s all beautifully and perfectly connected by the salmon which swim deep below.</p><p><em>Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCTravel/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a><em>, or follow us on&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Travel\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a><em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbc_travel/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a><em>.</em></p><p><em>If you liked this story,&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/?ocid=ear.bbc.email.we.email-signup\" target=\"_blank\">sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter</a><em>&nbsp;called \"The Essential List\".

Keeping the property granted the US valuable fishing and crabbing rights, he said, and a strategic Pacific Northwest foothold. For decades, the outpost was held as a military reserve, but in 1908 the United States granted the land to settlers, who were mainly Icelandic immigrants. More than 30 years ago, Iceland&rsquo;s president honoured the pioneers, dedicating a monument at the community&rsquo;s oldest cemetery.</p><p>Today, Point Roberts is a forested rural community, home to almost 1,300 full-time residents, hundreds of bald eagles and a few pods of killer whales who summer here. It&rsquo;s a place with a flashing traffic light, a few shops and little else.</p><p>Residents arriving from the booming Vancouver metro area, where the population is pushing 2.5 million, say they start to relax the moment they cross into this part of the United States. &ldquo;We call it the Point Roberts sigh,&rdquo; said Pat Grubb, who with his wife publishes the local newspaper, the All Point Bulletin.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07vtsbv\"}}</p><p>Indeed, with all the focus on <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46824649\" target=\"_blank\">the security of the US&rsquo; southern border with Mexico</a>, life appears laidback on this boundary with Canada. Driving Point Roberts&rsquo; northernmost street, Roosevelt Way, the international border is little more than a drainage ditch backing up to neatly trimmed hedges, planted to preserve Canadian homeowners&rsquo; backyard privacy, not their national sovereignty. Elsewhere, swing sets and football goalposts snuggle the boundary. The closest thing to a border wall is a shin-high concrete barrier marking the dead end of a neighbourhood road in the adjoining Canadian town of Tsawwassen.</p><p>But things may not be as placid as they seem.</p><blockquote><p> A persistent rumour describes Point Roberts as a popular resettlement site for the US Federal Witness Protection Program </p></blockquote><p>A persistent rumour describes Point Roberts as a popular resettlement site for the US Federal Witness Protection Program, an initiative to assist informants who testify against criminals. Folklore says dozens of people have been given new identities and relocated here. In 2012, Atlantic.com&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.citylab.com/design/2012/02/strange-existence-point-roberts-washington/1265/\" target=\"_blank\">City Lab</a> suggested that 50 residents could be in the program.</p><p>After all, anyone who arrives by car from the rest of the US must pass through two international border stations: one to enter Canada, and a second to re-enter the United States at Point Roberts. And Canada has especially strict regulations prohibiting entry to people with criminal histories, providing additional safeguards.</p><p>Tracy Evans, assistant general manager at Point Roberts&rsquo; Bald Eagle Golf Club, said she believes the story. A few people and incidents have seemed suspicious to her, and some of her neighbours keep completely to themselves. &ldquo;Think about it. It&rsquo;s a good place to put someone. It&rsquo;s a remote location. If you get into trouble in Miami, it would make sense for you to come up here.&rdquo;</p><p>Like many locals, Grubb laughs at the suggestion. But he does say that on a few occasions he&rsquo;s taken out his camera at a public meeting to snap a picture for publication and had people practically dive out of the way to avoid being photographed.</p><p>Even if the tale can&rsquo;t be confirmed, the town does attract distinct personalities.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07vtsby\"}}</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll meet someone, and you&rsquo;ll say &lsquo;What&rsquo;s your Point Roberts story?&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Swenson, author of Point Roberts Backstory, a local history book. &ldquo;You have a fun collection of free spirits. You have people into organics, and people who look after the eagles and know them by name. You have people into quilts, you have beekeepers, stamp collectors. Maybe a lot of towns have this, but the fact that we&rsquo;re all packed into five square miles, it&rsquo;s more pronounced.&rdquo;</p><p>Geography also creates unusual daily routines. Point Roberts has a primary school, but students past third grade must take a bus to classes in Blaine, Washington, a roundtrip of more than 50 miles that travels into Canada and back into the United States, requiring four border crossings a day. It&rsquo;s a familiar slog for residents, who make similar trips for doctor&rsquo;s appointments, or to pick up prescriptions or car license plates.</p><p>And then there are the quirks and hassles of living by an international boundary. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a big book of regulations of what can come over the border, and it changes frequently, and it&rsquo;s your obligation to keep up with it,&rdquo; Swenson said. &ldquo;These rules get very, very specific.&rdquo;</p><p>Some seem to defy logic, although they&rsquo;re meant to protect US agriculture from pests and diseases. Residents aren&rsquo;t allowed to bring in whole tomatoes, but sliced tomatoes are fine. Since bringing lamb into the United States is highly regulated due to concerns about the introduction of illnesses, pet owners must be careful about the dog food they purchase. During the height of fears about <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-45906585\" target=\"_blank\">mad cow disease</a>, Point Roberts school children had their lunches confiscated because their parents had packed roast beef sandwiches.</p><p>For many, Point Roberts&rsquo; appeal is sheer economics. Canadians own summer homes here because waterfront real estate is much cheaper than in the Vancouver area. And there&rsquo;s steady traffic year-round drawn by lower-priced petrol, milk and alcohol, due to lower US taxes and Canadian management of its dairy production that keeps prices high.</p><p>A 2013/14 <a href=\"https://cedar.wwu.edu/bpri_publications/102/\" target=\"_blank\">survey</a> from Western Washington University&rsquo;s Border Policy Research Institute indicated that nearly 40% of the border crossings into Point Roberts were to purchase petrol, Swenson said, which can yield Canadian drivers a savings of 20% to 30%. That explains why the town has 60 gas pumps, and why petrol stations list prices in litres, which is how fuel is sold in Canada.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p07vtsc3\"}}</p><p>Others come to pick up packages at one of the town&rsquo;s several shipping stores. By using a Point Roberts address, Canadians can receive online shopping from the United States. Not only is the price usually cheaper, but some products can&rsquo;t be shipped internationally. As geographer Mark Bjelland noted in the academic journal Geographical Review, the number of Canadians with registered mailboxes in Point Roberts is 40 times larger than the number of permanent residents.</p><p>The town also has a supermarket packed with more products and produce than could ever be consumed in this tiny community. The International Marketplace grocery tries to make it easier for its customers, noting which products can be taken into Canada: Idaho potatoes, sure; honeycrisp apples, absolutely not. It also has two cash drawers, one each for US and Canadian currency.</p><p>And an occasional visitor is drawn by the lure of a medium-rare hamburger. Strict Canadian health codes outlaw the pink-centred patty, feared to carry e coli and other food-borne diseases. But south of the border, anything goes, at least when it comes to grilled meat.

It was early May, and I chattered to myself in French as I cut north out of Qu&eacute;bec City, through Jacques-Cartier National Park, passing signs warning against collisions with moose and signalling turnoffs to lakes still cloaked in patchworks of ice. I was headed towards the shores and clifftops of <a href=\"http://parcmarin.qc.ca/page_details/the-saguenay-fjord/\" target=\"_blank\">one of the world&rsquo;s longest fjords</a>, hoping to glimpse whales, ride horses and practice a language that I&rsquo;ve spoken for most of my life, but never quite embraced as my own.</p><p>French wasn&rsquo;t something I chose for myself. The daughter of a Francophile father, I learned it through the <a href=\"http://dreamlandpublications.com/martine-story-books\" target=\"_blank\">Martine</a> storybooks my dad read to me at bedtime, a toddlerhood spent in Strasbourg and endless dad-mandated classes at summer camps and schools in the US, where I grew up. My dad has loved France since he was young. He&rsquo;s spent years in the country since his first stay as a high-school exchange student, and when I ask him what he loves about the place, he waxes on about friendships and food, beautiful cities and a particular <em>joie de vivre</em>. I now understand that he always wanted to share that with me.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06ysv31\"}}</p><p>My parents tell me that when I was two or three years old, I did have my own relationship with the language: I refused to speak it with them, yet happily babbled on with my babysitter in Strasbourg. But most of the French interactions I recall from my childhood happened in Paris during my self-conscious adolescence. I would tag along with my dad during holidays, bored by the same long meals and adult conversations he so enjoyed. And when I tried setting out on my own, even my most basic attempts to buy a croissant and talk to people were marked by brusque corrections of my American accent.</p><p><strong>You may also be interested in:</strong><br />&bull;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20180214-a-father-and-son-pilgrimage-on-the-tour-du-mont-blanc\" target=\"_blank\">The true &lsquo;granddaddy&rsquo; of the Alps</a><br />&bull;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/gallery/20170523-a-tempestuous-isle-of-1000-shipwrecks\" target=\"_blank\">The island of 1,000 shipwrecks</a><br />&bull;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20180307-after-100-hours-in-tibet-i-knew-it-was-time-to-leave\" target=\"_blank\">What it means to know when to leave</a></p><p>I kept returning to France with my dad well into adulthood, but I did so reluctantly, no longer wanting to talk for myself or explore on my own. I had lost confidence in my ability to get the language right, so I let go of my desire to speak it.</p><p>That is until the first time I visited Qu&eacute;bec 14 years ago as a graduate student. My decision to study in Montr&eacute;al had less to do with French itself than with my romantic notion of life in a bilingual city where I could, in theory, speak English too.</p><p>A relic of pre-revolutionary France, Canadian French retains old qualities that make it difficult for the uninitiated to grasp. &ldquo;We use words [the French] don&rsquo;t use anymore, and make distinctions between sounds they&rsquo;ve flattened,&rdquo; explained Emilie Nicolas, a Qu&eacute;bec-born linguistic anthropology graduate student at the University of Toronto.</p><p>Although my classes were in English, I lived in a French neighbourhood and was met with patience and smiles as I struggled with the mellifluous accent and unfamiliar local words. Something about the Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois diphthongs and nasally vowels lured me in. My interest in French was piqued &ndash; even if my painful linguistic past caused my confidence to remain low.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06ysttt\"}}</p><p>Qu&eacute;bec&rsquo;s own fraught linguistic history dates back to 1763, when France ceded the area to Britain. For the next 200 years, the local government filtered French out of schools and adopted measures that benefitted English speakers. By the 1960s, francophones remained worse off economically and socially than their anglophone counterparts, and a distinct cultural and class <a href=\"https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/francophone-anglophone-relations\" target=\"_blank\">divide</a> permeated the province.</p><p>The 1970s brought a push for pro-French language planning, and with it bills &ndash; like the Charter of the French Language &ndash; that explicitly linked French to <a href=\"https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/article/bill-101\" target=\"_blank\">Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois identity</a> and made it the only official language of the province. But, for some, the fear that French will once again come <a href=\"https://torontosun.com/2012/03/31/quebec-language-culture-threatened/wcm/9fae8ef8-0533-4fdb-acf2-8f6e0749a8bc\" target=\"_blank\">under attack</a> lingers. That tension was palpable for me in the nine months I lived in Montr&eacute;al. I never knew which language I was supposed to speak in a given situation, and each choice felt rife with culturally charged meaning that piled on my pre-existing anxiety.</p><p>So when I returned last spring, the irony wasn&rsquo;t lost on me. Here I was, searching for personal peace with French in a region where the language has been mired in discord for centuries. But this time, rather than staying in Montr&eacute;al, I headed deeper into the province and forced myself to plough through my timidity in a place where most people are monolingual.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06ystzn\"}}</p><p>As I stepped up to the car rental counter at Qu&eacute;bec City&rsquo;s Jean Lesage International Airport, I rehearsed my lines with the trepidation that comes from an upbringing of terse correction: \"<em>Je m'appelle Stacey McKenna. J'ai r&eacute;serv&eacute; une voiture</em>.\" I forced the words through the lump of nerves in my throat. The woman behind the counter beamed and began rattling off details &ndash; all in French. By the time I settled into my little red Volkswagen and set out on the road, I felt ready.</p><p>As I traced a loop from Qu&eacute;bec City to the Saguenay Fjord and through the region of Charlevoix, French started to feel like a key to the region&rsquo;s secrets. I arrived in the little town of L&rsquo;Anse-Saint-Jean just ahead of sea kayaking and whale watching season, so in the morning over breakfast, I asked my bilingual host (guiltily, in English) for advice. He suggested a nearby hike, then asked whether I spoke any French. &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; I replied, staring at my plate and pushing my egg around with my fork. &ldquo;But not nearly as well as you speak English.\"</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be shy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We like hearing your English accent.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p> I felt my belly warm with a newfound affection for the tiny but significant experiences that French &ndash; even my imperfect French &ndash; might unlock here </p></blockquote><p>According to Richard Bourhis, linguistic psychologist at Universit&eacute; du Qu&eacute;bec &agrave; Montr&eacute;al, schooling on pronunciation tends to be less rigid in Qu&eacute;bec than in France, which likely creates a difference in how foreign speakers are perceived. &ldquo;[In France] they're taught that they can&rsquo;t make mistakes in French, so they don't want you to make a mistake,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Francophones all over Canada don't mind using English or French with all kinds of accents&hellip; so long as we can understand each other.&rdquo;</p><p>As my host had warned, the trail was still slick with snowmelt. I followed it upward &ndash; scanning the forest for signs of moose as I went &ndash; and soon found myself tromping through lingering drifts.</p><p>I turned back before the snow got too deep to cross in trainers, and on my descent, I ran into a group dressed far more appropriately for the muddy spring terrain than I. They asked me in French if there was still snow on top, and to my surprise, I didn&rsquo;t hesitate. &ldquo;<em>Je ne sais pas. Je ne suis pas all&eacute;e au sommet</em>.&rdquo; (&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I didn&rsquo;t go to the summit.&rdquo;) They smiled, thanked me and continued their ascent. I felt my belly warm with a newfound affection for the tiny but significant experiences that French &ndash; even my imperfect French &ndash; might unlock here.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06ystwt\"}}</p><p>The next day, I headed to Baie-Sainte-Catherine, where I caught a whale-watching boat through the Saguenay-St Lawrence Marine Park. Bracing against the wind and the rocking waves, I squinted, hoping to spot the tell-tale spray from a blowhole. As I listened to the on-board scientist talking easily in French and English about the underwater ecosystems, I wondered whether, by resisting for all these years, I&rsquo;d squandered my own chance at bilingualism.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a mistake French-Canadians seem less likely to make, as Qu&eacute;bec&rsquo;s French-speaking population is currently driving an <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/language-bilingualism-census-data-1.4231737\" target=\"_blank\">increase in Canada&rsquo;s bilingualism rate</a>. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re very francophone still, but we don&rsquo;t see speaking multiple languages as an either/or thing,&rdquo; Nicolas said. &ldquo;It adds. It doesn&rsquo;t erase or threaten who you are in the same way it once did.&rdquo;</p><p>This attitude was evident all over the province: at the <a href=\"http://museedufjord.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Mus&eacute;e du Fjord</a> in Saguenay; the cafe in Baie-Saint-Paul; the restaurant in Qu&eacute;bec City. Over and over again, people encouraged me with their patience, asked where I had learned French and complimented my efforts. Inspired by the chance to practice this familiar language in a new, friendlier setting, I suddenly found myself overwhelmed by the pleasure of speaking French. I started drawing out conversations and asking for directions and recommendations I didn&rsquo;t need. French had lost its tarnish. But more than that, it was becoming mine.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06ysv96\"}}</p><p>When I returned to Qu&eacute;bec City, I walked cobbled streets below matte metal roofs. The sky was grey, and I was reminded of days dawdling around Paris with my father. Grateful for the years he had insisted I learn his favourite language, I pulled out my phone and texted: \"<em>Je suis &agrave; Qu&eacute;bec. C'est bon, mais &ccedil;a serait mieux si tu &eacute;tais ici</em>.\" (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in Qu&eacute;bec. It's good, but it would be better if you were here.&rdquo;) He agreed, and suggested we visit Qu&eacute;bec together one day.</p><blockquote><p> French had lost its tarnish&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;but more than that, it was becoming mine </p></blockquote><p>After five days on the mostly francophone roads of rural Qu&eacute;bec, I hopped a train to Montr&eacute;al, home to the majority of the province&rsquo;s bilingual residents and much of its linguistic tension. Six months prior, provincial legislators had <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42200730\" target=\"_blank\">unanimously approved a motion</a> banning the city&rsquo;s ubiquitous &lsquo;bonjour-hi&rsquo; greeting. For nationalists, the phrase is a symbolic threat against French. But according to Bourhis, it&rsquo;s an embrace of bilingualism, and a way to welcome people of either mother tongue. And despite the resolution, it isn&rsquo;t going anywhere.</p><p>I dropped my bags at my hotel and headed to a glass-fronted restaurant near Old Montr&eacute;al for lunch. As I took my seat, the server offered a cheery &ldquo;Bonjour, hi!&rdquo;. I returned the greeting, and in French free from fear, asked to see a menu.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/columns/travel-journeys\" target=\"_blank\">Travel Journeys</a> <em>is a BBC Travel series exploring travellers&rsquo; inner journeys of transformation and growth as they experience the world.</em></p><p><em>Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCTravel/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a><em>, or follow us on&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Travel\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a><em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbc_travel/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a><em>.</em></p><p><em>If you liked this story,&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/?ocid=ear.bbc.email.we.email-signup\" target=\"_blank\">sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter</a><em>&nbsp;called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

I had arrived in the middle of one of Montreal&rsquo;s worst heatwaves in decades.</p><p>I raised the bottle and poured its contents into a frosted mug. The clear, effervescent brew had scarcely foamed to the top before it was at my lips. As I eagerly took my first sip, I was immediately hit with the unmistakable, biting taste of conifer &ndash; like a liquefied Christmas tree.

Even so, on such a sweltering day, it wouldn&rsquo;t feel a stretch to say the drink saved my life. As legend has it, this beer has something of a reputation for saving lives.</p><p>Dany Roy is the proprietor and spruce brewmaster of this poutine shop, <a href=\"http://www.bieredepinette.ca/restaurant-paul-patates/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul</a><a href=\"http://www.bieredepinette.ca/restaurant-paul-patates/\" target=\"_blank\"> Patate</a><a href=\"http://www.bieredepinette.ca/restaurant-paul-patates/\">s</a>. Though factory-produced spruce beer is commercially available in many Canadian supermarkets, Roy&rsquo;s particular brew has gained something of legendary status among locals. As far as Roy knows, his restaurant is one of a few remaining places in Canada where one can find authentic, homemade spruce beer. Brewed and bottled in the shop&rsquo;s small back room, Roy&rsquo;s spruce beer is still made &lsquo;the old fashioned way&rsquo;, through fermentation and yeast (though the process is stopped while the alcohol content is minimal). Though the recipe has remained relatively unchanged over the last century, Roy claims the story of spruce beer&rsquo;s origins stretches back even further.</p><blockquote><p> This beer has something of a reputation for saving lives </p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;First of all, we all know that the spruce beer was made by the [indigenous peoples]. They used it like a medicine,&rdquo; he explained. Of course, the spruce beer used by the First Nations peoples was a far cry from the fizzy pop found in Roy&rsquo;s shop. Theirs was a decoction made by boiling the ground bark and leaves of coniferous trees. One of the earliest written mentions of the drink and its purported medicinal properties came from the accounts of French navigator Jacques Cartier. In the account of Cartier&rsquo;s exploration of the St Lawrence River in the winter of 1536, an unnamed sailor wrote of a vicious bout of scurvy, caused by a Vitamin C deficiency, that ravaged the expedition.</p><p>&ldquo;The sickness broke out among us accompanied by most marvellous and extraordinary symptoms,&rdquo; the author wrote. &ldquo;For some lost all their strength, their legs became swollen and inflamed, while the sinews contracted and turned as black as coal&hellip; of the 110 men forming our company, there were not 10 in good health so that no-one could aid the other, which was a grievous sight considering the place where we were.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06vw097\"}}</p><p>Just as things looked darkest for Cartier and his men, salvation came from the local Iroquois tribe in the form of a life-saving elixir. Made from the boiled bark and evergreen tips of a regional conifer, the concoction reportedly cured every man bold enough to try it. &ldquo;A whole tree as large and as tall as any I ever saw was used up,&rdquo; the account reads, &ldquo;and produced such a result that had all the doctors of Louvain and Montpellier been there, with all the drugs of Alexandria, they could not have done so much in a year as did this tree in eight days.&rdquo;</p><p>Named &lsquo;Anneda&rsquo; by the local tribes, the exact species of the tree is still a mystery, though it is thought to have been the white cedar or the balsam fir. Regardless of the species, evergreen trees in general contain surprisingly <a href=\"http://images.biomedsearch.com/1102818/medhist00113-0029.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIBOKHYOLP4MBMRGQ&amp;Expires=1545264000&amp;Signature=yjopVW8D6PyHAmPILmoRAr1pLAY%3D\" target=\"_blank\">high concentrations of Vitamin C</a> in their needles.</p><p>Though the decoction written about in the accounts of Cartier&rsquo;s voyage is more a herbal tea than the effervescent beverage Roy sells, Roy considers this to be one of the earliest forms of modern spruce beer. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where it all started,&rdquo; Roy said. &ldquo;After that, people transformed it. They started fermenting it.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06vw03m\"}}</p><p>The fermented iteration of spruce beer enjoyed a stint of fame, rising to prominence after it was praised and popularised by famed nutritionist James Lind in his <a href=\"http://www.jameslindlibrary.org/lind-j-1753/\" target=\"_blank\">Treatise on Scurvy</a> published in 1753. After observing its effects on sailors afflicted with scurvy, Lind wrote:</p><p>&ldquo;Spruce beer, made of the black spruce, either fresh or dried, or from its essence, is an excellent medicine. This beer must be drank daily, and the parts affected with the eruption [of scurvy] bathed with it night and morning.&rdquo;</p><p>Lind&rsquo;s writings inspired the British Navy to make the elixir a standard ration for long sea voyages. It was even lauded by Captain Cook in his written accounts of his voyages across the world.

Still, even though the recipe and preparation methods have changed since the time of Cartier, the myth surrounding spruce beer&rsquo;s purported healing qualities has endured.</p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say that it can cure people, but sure enough people who come here in the winter swear that they don&rsquo;t catch a cold, all because they&rsquo;re drinking the spruce beer,&rdquo; Roy said, a note of scepticism in his voice.</p><p>Though the wonders of spruce beer may never have reached international renown, it nevertheless maintained its hold in Canada &ndash; specifically in Quebec, as Roy explained. &ldquo;People here used to brew it in their bathtubs, back in the &lsquo;20s and &lsquo;30s,&rdquo; Roy said, &ldquo;When they finished brewing they put it in heavy bottles, usually Champagne ones, and brought it to their roofs to ferment. When the bottles started popping, that&rsquo;s how you knew the spruce beer was ready.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06vw0gb\"}}</p><p>Roy&rsquo;s own brand of spruce beer has become a cultural icon. Roy&rsquo;s father Paul opened the restaurant in the 1950s, but the recipe Roy uses has been around since the 1800s. Using no factory machines or carbonators, Roy does his brewing alone in a small, temperature-controlled room in the back of the restaurant. He&rsquo;s remarkably secretive about his process, but he did indulge me with the knowledge of two key ingredients: oil extracted from black spruce, just as Lind recommended; and the water from Montreal, which Roy claims to have just the right purity level to produce his spruce beer&rsquo;s unique taste.</p><p>For those outside Montreal hoping to get a taste of the legendary brew, options are scant. Roy&rsquo;s spruce beer has a short shelf life, so it must be enjoyed fresh. What&rsquo;s more, the heavy brown bottles are for more than just show; they&rsquo;re the only bottles strong enough to withstand the pressure built up during fermentation, but if not properly temperature-controlled, they run the risk of exploding. In order for customers to qualify for a special delivery, Roy said that they must have extenuating circumstances.</p><p>&ldquo;There was a man in Newfoundland who was dying of cancer. His last wish was to taste real spruce beer one more time, so his wife contacted me,&rdquo; Roy recalled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s usually a problem to ship it by plane because of the pressure, but I made some phone calls and there was a pilot who agreed to keep it in the cockpit with him. In the end, he was able to have it before he passed. That was the only time we ever shipped it this way.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06vw05n\"}}</p><p>For most people, a trek to Montreal is all they need to do to get their hands on a genuine spruce beer. Although no promises can be made about whether it can cure any ailments, there&rsquo;s still something to be said for the invigorating taste of fresh spruce on a hot summer day in Canada.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/columns/strange-brews\" target=\"_blank\">Strange Brews</a> <em>is a BBC Travel series that invites you to indulge in one-of-a-kind beers from all over the world.</em></p><p><em>Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCTravel/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a><em>, or follow us on&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Travel\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a><em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbc_travel/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a><em>.</em></p><p><em>If you liked this story,&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/?ocid=ear.bbc.email.we.email-signup\" target=\"_blank\">sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter</a><em>&nbsp;called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

Or so it looked from the vantage point of the revving snowmobile as it lurched across the tundra basin. Around 3,000 wild reindeer had bunched together on the horizon, their branched horns seamlessly melding with an endless swathe of skeletal willow and black spruce. We were 60km south of the Arctic Ocean in the remote northern reaches of Canada&rsquo;s Northwest Territories, and left to Mother Nature it was a spectacle unaffected by man for millennia.</p><p>Two bushy foxes bounded across the permafrost, scattering the herd downhill past shoreline lichen onto a frozen lake ahead. The hush of the Arctic winter broken, the herd became a flurry of tawny hides and hooves.</p><blockquote><p> That&rsquo;s the sound of the tundra </p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Inuvialuit (Western Canadian Inuit) guide Noel Cockney softly, as he stopped his Ski-Doo and gestured across the ice. It was -25C and his voice barely pierced his thick protective face mask. &ldquo;When the reindeer run, it sounds like rain on snow. That&rsquo;s the sound of the tundra.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Hidden deep at the top of the country&rsquo;s largely unexplored Arctic perimeter, Canada&rsquo;s largest reindeer herd have long lived in solitude. Every spring, the scruffy animals migrate west to their calving grounds on nearby Richards Island to rear their young, but these days they have more to contend with than just wily foxes and wolf packs.</p><p>They now have to deal with the arrival of man.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p061zcdy\"}}</p><p><strong>You may also be interested in:<br /></strong>&bull;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/gallery/20170726-the-people-who-want-to-buy-a-railroad\" target=\"_blank\">The people who want to buy a railroad</a><br />&bull;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/gallery/20170502-a-518km-ice-road-across-the-tundra\" target=\"_blank\">An ice road mapped by dog sled</a><br />&bull;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/gallery/20180121-route-e69-norways-icy-marvel-of-engineering\" target=\"_blank\">Norway&rsquo;s icy marvel of engineering</a></p><p>For the last two millennia, the only people who have been able to understand and adapt to this land are the Inuvialuit, the custodians of the north who live in settlements across the Mackenzie Delta, where Canada&rsquo;s longest river system empties into the Arctic Ocean. Numbering around 5,700, the Inuvialuit have maintained a lifestyle as traditional as it gets in the Americas.&nbsp;In step with the seasons, they are bound to the land, trapping Arctic hare, fox and lynx for meat and fur in the colder months; in summer they harvest beluga whales during sanctioned hunts along the Tuktoyaktuk coast to provide the sustenance they need to get through the long winter.</p><p>The opening of the Inuvik-Tuktoyaktuk Highway in November 2017 has changed everything for this frozen wilderness. Built at a cost of CAD$300 million and nicknamed the Arctic Ice Road, the 137km-long, two-lane gravel highway is the first all-weather road to Canada&rsquo;s Arctic Coast, cleaving this isolated tract of tundra in two.</p><p>The highway could also be described as the world&rsquo;s toughest. Taking four years to build &ndash; three to create a thick-enough layer of hard-packed gravel to withstand the harsh winters, and one to refine the surface &ndash; it&rsquo;s been designed to tolerate temperatures that can tip below -40C as well as hit 20C on summer nights when the sun never sets.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p061zdp0\"}}</p><p>And yet even though this is a lifeline for the remote indigenous Inuvialuit community of Tuktoyaktuk (population: 850), the last Arctic village on the edge of mainland Canada&rsquo;s frozen wilderness, the road is proving divisive. Conceived as a path to oil and gas exploration by former prime minister Stephen Harper&rsquo;s administration, some see it as a road to resources (despite a <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-obama-arctic-1.3905933\" target=\"_blank\">temporary moratorium&nbsp;on offshore licences</a> from Justin Trudeau&rsquo;s government). Others call it a vanity project, bringing this fragile community one step closer to cultural erosion.</p><p>But for its ardent supporters, including Tuktoyaktuk local Noel Cockney who spent two years working on the road, the highway marks a rebirth for this ultra-remote community. Opening the outpost year round to visitors for the first time ever, it is an opportunity for progress and possibility. In summer, drivers can now reach otherwise inaccessible lakes and rivers, many of which have never been explored. In winter, there is the visceral thrill of witnessing the reindeer herd and driving to out-of-touch Tuktoyaktuk, whose name means &lsquo;looks like a caribou&rsquo; in the local language. And for locals, the new route is a potential honeypot for attracting investment and jobs.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p061zcmy\"}}</p><p>Prior to the Inuvik-Tuktoyaktuk Highway, the community&rsquo;s winter connection to the outside world was a rudimentary and ephemeral ice track that melted every spring.</p><p>&ldquo;Getting to &lsquo;Tuk&rsquo; used to be incredibly difficult,&rdquo; said Cockney, parking his snowmobile at a viewpoint overlooking the new highway. &ldquo;In winter, our way out vanished into thin air, and in summer it was a choice of two: fly or take a boat along the river.&rdquo; Now, since the road&rsquo;s arrival, local carrier Aklak Air has suspended its daily service.</p><blockquote><p> The value of keeping these cultural traditions alive can&rsquo;t be underestimated </p></blockquote><p>Another individual embracing the road&rsquo;s opportunity is Kylik Kisoun Taylor, a second-generation Inuvialuit who represents the vanguard of the next generation of northerners. A board member of the <a href=\"https://indigenoustourism.ca/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Indigenous Tourism Association of Canada</a> and owner of <a href=\"http://tundranorthtours.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tundra North Tours</a>, an Inuit company based in the village of Inuvik at the southernmost point of the road, Taylor grew up in southern Ontario but felt the call of the north from the moment he returned at age 16.</p><p>&ldquo;Indigenous culture is a resource here and tourism has the power to harness it,&rdquo; he told me, clad in seal fur, as we pulled out of Inuvik while driving the new road north. &ldquo;Whether it&rsquo;s trapping a duck or killing a caribou with a spear &ndash; the value of keeping these cultural traditions alive can&rsquo;t be underestimated. Indigenous communities are forgetting how to use these Arctic skills, but they can be compatible with tourism and the modern world. And I want to educate visitors about this.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p061zdl1\"}}</p><p>For all that the highway divides local opinion, to drive it is mesmerising. Far from an arrow-straight highway, it loops and bends, hugging the north&rsquo;s frozen ponds, the so-called Eskimo Lakes, a system of brackish estuarine basins. At the roadside, the Richardson Mountains and boreal forest fade until they disappear completely, leaving the windshield crowded with nothing but a panorama of bald ice. And there are so many shades of white, the sky takes on a pale-coloured glow.</p><p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t seen the Arctic unless you come in winter,&rdquo; said Taylor as we passed a huge plateau of ice. Up close, wind-blown snow rushed the road, moving gravel like an illusion. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re at the edge of the tree line here &ndash; this is the limit of where it&rsquo;s comfortable to live.&rdquo;</p><p>Past a series of pingos, periglacial landforms made of earth-covered ice that are Canadian national landmarks, Tuktoyaktuk began to make its presence felt. As if divorced from its own country, the village sits segregated on a spit of land jutting out into the Arctic Ocean. There are no sugar maple or spruce, or any trees for that matter &ndash; only endless ocean, the cold grey waves frozen and paused.</p><p>{\"gallery\":{\"pid\":\"p061zf15\"}}</p><p>Two and a half hours after setting off, we finally parked near a pier entombed in ice. Tuktoyaktuk&rsquo;s streets were empty from the cold. The husky huts, where sled dog teams bedded down, were shut for the night. No-one was around except at the <a href=\"https://ookpiktours.ca/accommodation-tuktoyaktuk\" target=\"_blank\">Tuktu B&amp;B</a>, where I met owner Maureen Pokiak, who discussed the road&rsquo;s impact with me over dinner. Her husband, James, she apologised, was out on an overnight musk ox hunt.</p><blockquote><p> The road may make life a lot easier for folk in the longer term, but we&rsquo;ll remain connected to the land </p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;This community is in our blood, so I don&rsquo;t anticipate too many changes,&rdquo; she said, while sharpening a traditional ulu knife to prepare a customary indigenous meal &ndash; raw beluga whale, or <em>muktuk</em>. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a hardcore element who love the extremes of this environment, and they live and breathe tradition. The road may make life a lot easier for folk in the longer term, but we&rsquo;ll remain connected to the land &ndash; that&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;ll always be.&rdquo;</p><p>Only when our truck headed back south to Inuvik in the darkness, the street lights diffusing a glow across the snow, did I start to understand what she meant. As the road crossed a series of humpback hills, the Arctic sun rose to reveal the ever-shifting beauty of the tundra, the epic drama of the landscape lit in an all-encompassing brilliant silver on white. Out in the pre-dawn light, the reindeer herd were moving on, the sound of &lsquo;rain&rsquo; on snow a signal that life in the tundra will go on.

I&rsquo;d been picking up bits and pieces about this &lsquo;screech-in&rsquo; ceremony, a welcome ritual of sorts that transforms an outsider into an honorary Newfoundlander. It&rsquo;s not a compulsory ritual for visitors to the province, but if your host or friend thinks you might enjoy it, they will likely take you to one. I&rsquo;d been brought to Burton, a screech-in expert who has been performing the ritual for the past 15 years here in her native Seal Cove. I only knew that there was a possibility of kissing a fish and a good chance I&rsquo;d be downing shots of rum.

Although <a href=\"https://www.downhomelife.com/article.php?id=1905\" target=\"_blank\">it&rsquo;s often attributed to a teacher</a>, no-one has ever definitively been proven to be its inventor.</p><p>According to Joan Sullivan, a native of the province&rsquo;s capital city of St John&rsquo;s and managing editor of arts and culture journal the <a href=\"http://nqonline.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Newfoundland Quarterly</a>, the screech-in likely evolved from the bar scene of George Street in St John&rsquo;s, where visitors to the province would be taken for a night of lively music and entertainment, Newfoundland style. However, the tradition soon faded away, in part, she explained, due to &ldquo;the government under Clyde Wells, a strong critic of screech-ins, in the late 1980s, which kind of discouraged it.&rdquo; She continued, &ldquo;But in the &lsquo;90s, the screech-in became a promotional tool of the Newfoundland liquor board. So the screech-in came back, and now it&rsquo;s very much a force of its own.&rdquo;</p><p>Although Sullivan is one of the generation of Newfoundlanders who considers screech-ins to be &lsquo;something not of Newfoundland&rsquo;, she admits that &ldquo;Many people seem to really enjoy the screech-in, and lots of people make a living doing it.&rdquo; She continued, &ldquo;Maybe someone made it up, but now the screech-in is a tradition, and it&rsquo;s changing into its own thing.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06qht25\"}}</p><p>Standing beside me in a red plaid shirt, also sporting rubber boots and a sou&rsquo;wester&rsquo;, Burton handed me an &lsquo;ugly stick&rsquo;, a mop handle-turned-traditional&nbsp;Newfoundland musical instrument. She began: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re becoming an honorary Newfoundlander. In Newfoundland, we have traditions. First, you got to have a piece of this bologna,&rdquo; she said, holding out a little plate with a half slice of the meat product.</p><p>Burton explained that while it had become more expensive, bologna used to be cheap to buy and therefore was commonly eaten in the province.</p><blockquote><p> Maybe someone made it up, but now the screech-in is a tradition, and it&rsquo;s changing into its own thing </p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;And then you got to have a piece of this hard bread.&rdquo; My host held out a plate with a piece of what is known here as Purity Hard Bread. This was a food of fishermen away at sea for weeks, who would soak the hard bread in water and mix it with pieces of cod. As I gnawed on the tough bread, my audience laughed in approval. Burton intervened, catching me mid-chew: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to say something now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Repeat after me: &lsquo;Deed I is me old cock, and long may yer big jib draw&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>The tumbling words crashed into me, the strong Newfoundlander accent sounding rather Irish; not surprisingly, of course, since Irish emigration to Newfoundland occurred in waves from the late 1600s, reaching its peak in the early 1800s. I laughed at the idea of pronouncing this tongue-twisting phrase. Burton told me that the first part simply meant &lsquo;Indeed I am, my old friend&rsquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Jib. What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; I grabbed onto the strange word in an attempt to stall. Everyone started to discuss its meaning until I heard someone claim that a jib is a sail. Later, I learned from Jackie Hillier, a librarian at the <a href=\"https://www.library.mun.ca/cns/\" target=\"_blank\">Centre for Newfoundland Studies</a>, that if your jib draws wind, sailing will be good. &ldquo;Usually this was used as a good wish for the future,&rdquo; she explained.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06qhts7\"}}</p><p>Sam subsequently told me that the phrases used in the screech-in represent a dialect that is quickly disappearing, especially in St John&rsquo;s. &ldquo;These phrases are wishing the outsider good luck in their travels. How nice is that? It&rsquo;s a lovely message that embodies what most people leave Newfoundland thinking about us, that we&rsquo;re the nicest people in the world.&rdquo;</p><p>I took a deep breath, repeating the phrase to uproarious laughter. I laughed too, simply with relief that I&rsquo;d tried.</p><p>&ldquo;Now have this dried squid,&rdquo; Burton said.</p><p>I chose the smallest piece, just in case.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06qhtmx\"}}</p><p>I thought I might be done, until Burton sidled up to me and said, &ldquo;How can you do ar-thing when you got nar-thing to do ar-thing wit?&rdquo; There was that impossible accent again.</p><p>The audience burst into peals of laughter again, and I tried not choke on my squid, shaking my head and smiling until my cheeks hurt.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, slow down,&rdquo; I told a sparkly-eyed Burton. I moved closer to try and lip-read.</p><p>Burton repeated it slowly, and I followed in my mangled Newfoundlander accent as my very kind audience giggled and guffawed.</p><p>I translated the phrase as &lsquo;How can you do anything if you&rsquo;ve got nothing to do anything with?&rsquo;. Burton confirmed my translation. The phrase was tinged with melancholy, yet it also sounded very practical. Somehow, this made me feel like I understood the people of Newfoundland a little better. In such an isolated and remote place, the people did what they could with the resources provided by Mother Nature, living off the land and sea, hunting moose, fishing for cod and squid. But this also meant having to survive when resources were less than abundant.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06qht86\"}}</p><p>Finally came the words everyone had been waiting for: &ldquo;Now you kiss the cod!&rdquo;</p><p>My audience shrieked with excitement as Burton approached, pointing a large, frozen codfish directly at me, mouth first. Cod fishing was the province&rsquo;s life-giving industry for several centuries until the early 1990s, when the government <a href=\"https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/economy/moratorium.php\" target=\"_blank\">placed a moratorium on the practice</a> due to depleted stock. Today, the fish is making a slow, tentative comeback and is still intrinsically linked to the local culture.</p><p>I pecked the very cold, barely thawed fish on what I decided were its lips. The crowd went wild, and I felt relieved that the weirdest part of this ceremony was over.</p><p>Finally, Burton led me to the table where I was instructed to pour myself a shot from a plastic bottle of spiced rum labelled &lsquo;Newfoundland Screech&rsquo; and shoot it down.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06qhv3l\"}}</p><p>Originally, this Caribbean-origin rum had no name. Thousands of litres of rum were brought by sailors from the British West Indies or Jamaica in exchange for salted cod, a trade practice dating back about 250 years. The Newfoundland government eventually began to bottle the rum in the early 20th Century, selling it sans label until the time when, as legend has it, an American sailor in Newfoundland downed a shot of the rum and gave out a &lsquo;screech&rsquo;. Hence, the name of the liquor, and consequently, the screech-in ceremony.</p><p>This entire time, I&rsquo;d kept the ugly stick upright with one hand, but now Burton instructed me to start banging it on the ground. Without warning, she began to circle around me, skipping and high-stepping, dancing some kind of traditional jig. Suddenly she hooked her arm around mine and pulled me into the dance.</p><p>When the song ended and we&rsquo;d wiped our sweaty foreheads, Burton presented me with my screech-in certificate, sponsored by none other than Captain Morgan of rum fame. Burton told me you could now purchase packs of these certificates at the dollar store. The original certificate from the Newfoundland liquor board, however, had looked slightly different and included the signature of Premier Wells. But that version disappeared in 1989 when Wells ordered all certificates with his signature<a href=\"https://www.downhomelife.com/article.php?id=1905\" target=\"_blank\"> to be shredded</a>&nbsp;due to widespread debate about how the ritual was a debasement of Newfoundland&rsquo;s culture. That same year, Newfoundland&rsquo;s Heritage Coalition sponsored a contest to create a tradition that would replace the screech-in, but nothing came of it.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06qhtdh\"}}</p><blockquote><p> Who wouldn&rsquo;t want to be an honorary Newfoundlander? </p></blockquote><p>When I asked Sam what she thought about the screech-in controversy, she immediately responded, &ldquo;But aren&rsquo;t all traditions invented?&rdquo; She continued, &ldquo;I consider the screech-in a staple of the Newfoundland culture because of how well it reflects our province and its history. The cod embodies the success and the hardships of what it truly means to be a Newfoundlander. We&rsquo;re resilient.

But what I was really hoping for was some of my grandfather&rsquo;s good luck. In his lifetime, he amassed a sizeable sum (and then lost it all) panning for gold. If I could channel just an ounce of his prosperous spirit, I&rsquo;d be leaving a richer man.</p><blockquote><p> If I could channel just an ounce of his prosperous spirit, I&rsquo;d be leaving a richer man </p></blockquote><p>With my patience running thin, I did my best to employ a method I learned in Dawson City, a nearby mining town where gold was first discovered in 1896. The trick, a local explained to me, was to tilt the pan back and forth and create tiny ripples across the surface. These undulations help the valuable metal break away from the dirt. The murky, coffee-coloured mixture, which comprised a few scoops of dirt and river water, swirled around the surface of my plate-sized saucer before splashing down between my legs. No matter how methodically I swished the contents of my pan, only clumps of mud remained.</p><p>Overhead, dark, bloated clouds swallowed the spring sky and sent tiny pellets of hail hurling in my direction. When a gust of wind kicked off my hat, the festive optimism of the day slithered downstream with it. Resigned, I tossed my muddy boots, along with my dignity, into the trunk of my rental car.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06fsqs4\"}}</p><p><strong>You may also be interested in:</strong><br />&bull;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20180712-an-ingenious-way-to-hide-a-map\" target=\"_blank\">An ingenious way to hide a map</a><br />&bull;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20180228-how-an-italian-town-changed-me\" target=\"_blank\">How an Italian town changed me</a><br />&bull;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20180214-a-father-and-son-pilgrimage-on-the-tour-du-mont-blanc\" target=\"_blank\">The true &lsquo;granddaddy&rsquo; of the Alps</a></p><p>My maternal grandfather, Eugene, was more fastidious than me. He pursued his lifelong dream of becoming a gold prospector for decades, not just one afternoon. To him, mining was more than just a hobby; it was his ticket out of a poor, immigrant upbringing in St Louis, Missouri. Anyone with grit and perseverance could do it, he believed, and it didn&rsquo;t require a high school diploma &ndash; something he never obtained.</p><p>I only knew my grandfather during his twilight years, when the struggles of his childhood were recited to us grandkids like fables. A son of Polish immigrants, Eugene dropped out of school so he could work and help support his parents and three siblings. He worked as a porter at St Louis&rsquo; Union Station and delivered newspapers to his neighbourhood, earning cents for a day&rsquo;s work. A child of the Great Depression, he never lost sight of the value of money, even in its smallest amounts.</p><blockquote><p> If there was a canyon, a river, there must be gold </p></blockquote><p>In 1962, Eugene moved his wife and daughter (my mother) from St Louis to California when he heard miners were discovering gold along the banks of the Feather River in the Sacramento Valley. Soon after, he began taking annual expeditions to this mineral-rich waterway, where he hauled bulky equipment down steep canyon trails and sifted through endless pounds of sediment and bedrock. In between these pilgrimages, he stayed closer to his home and panned in the riverbeds of the East Fork River in southern California's Azusa Canyon.</p><p>Family members, including my mother, often got lassoed into his grand agenda, but no-one matched his passion. He hoarded stacks of trade magazines that littered his dining room table and scoured their pages for information on new products and land claims. These publications provided him a portal into a distant land: Canada&rsquo;s Klondike River. For gold prospectors, the Klondike was the industry&rsquo;s Mecca. It was a place where claim owners were still finding gold decades after it was discovered.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06fsqz1\"}}</p><p>My mother found his prized collection of magazines in a hallway after his death, and over her lifetime she witnessed her father&rsquo;s gold fever escalate from a part-time hobby to a full-blown obsession. &ldquo;The Klondike was too far, but the California Gold Rush, that was doable,&rdquo; my mother told me. &ldquo;That would be a more feasible way to find his riches.&rdquo;</p><p>His strategy to stay in California paid off. On a land claim he purchased in Amador County, he discovered a nugget the size of a drawing pin during one of his early expeditions, and it inspired him to keep digging. &ldquo;If there was a canyon, a river, there must be gold,&rdquo; my mother said.</p><p>He returned to that spot year after year, collecting jars and coffee cans filled with black sand and the precious metal. He&rsquo;d melt down whatever gold dust, flakes and grains he&rsquo;d find into larger pieces, and when I was born, he gave my mother an ounce of raw gold that she could pass on to me someday.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06fsqq8\"}}</p><p>In his first two years on the river, Eugene dug up roughly $5,000 worth of gold &ndash; the equivalent of more than $41,000 today. But as the years wore on, more money was going into the ground than coming out of it. His equipment needed constant repairs, and transportation to and from these remote canyons became increasingly costly. He even started scuba diving, hoping that if he went deeper into the riverbeds, there would be more to find.</p><p>The industry was also changing. Large, industrialised dredging machines were sucking up all the gold, and Eugene loathed the end of &lsquo;Mom-and-Pop&rsquo; operators, who, like him, preferred to do most of their panning by hand. He chronicled his frustrations and the difficulties he faced in handwritten letters to my grandmother, his &lsquo;Little Eagle&rsquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Finally the rain is over,&rdquo; he wrote in a letter dated 26 August 1976. &ldquo;We moved to another beautiful bedrock upstream. Two big boulders could fall or slide and trap us.&rdquo; In the crease of the letter, as if justifying to my grandmother that the mission was still worth it, he wrote, &ldquo;Got some nuggets&rdquo;.</p><blockquote><p> Being on the river gave him a sense of self and belonging he searched for his entire life </p></blockquote><p>Eventually he bought a local jewellery shop, where he worked as a watchmaker while my grandma managed the books. Together, they bought and sold scrap gold necklaces, tennis bracelets, coins and even dental fillings. For my grandpa, it was a small way for him to remain tethered to his passion. He longed for the days of being outdoors, and above his workbench he hung a photo of his favourite place: the Feather River.</p><p>&ldquo;He did what he could to stay connected to it,&rdquo; my mother said, as we thumbed through his old, faded photographs and letters she found in an album.</p><p>My grandfather&rsquo;s tall tales of hiking into the Sierra Nevada mountains and camping on unnamed beaches made their way so often around the dinner table that we still recite them to this day &ndash; like the time his gear had to be helicoptered down into his campsite, rather than abort the mission altogether. Being on the river gave him a sense of self and belonging he searched for his entire life.</p><p>&ldquo;There was this deep-seated void that I cannot explain to you,&rdquo; my mother said. &ldquo;I just lived through it.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06fsr2r\"}}</p><p>My journey into my familial past began in Whitehorse, Yukon&rsquo;s largest city, where I drove north along the Klondike Highway, tracing the edges of the Yukon River and the historical route miners first took when they arrived to the region by steamboats. Alone in my car, I marvelled at the endless mountain vistas that were waking up from their long winter&rsquo;s freeze and rivers that were slowly breaking free, ready to flow into a new season. Soon, the frosty weather would melt under the midnight sun, and the gold-mining industry &ndash; which still makes up the largest portion of the local economy &ndash; would spring to life.</p><p>On the outskirts of Dawson City, the host of my homestay, Kim, flagged me down when she saw me heading in the wrong direction past her house. It was obvious I wasn&rsquo;t from around here and she knew it.</p><p>\"It's the northern way to help those who might be lost,\" she said. Coming from the US, where we&rsquo;re taught to run from strangers, this was a welcome change.</p><p>I was staying in a yurt on her property, and from inside my tent I could hear the rush of the Klondike 5m away down a sloped bank. I asked if I could dip my feet in, but Kim shot me down. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to cross it,&rdquo; she warned.</p><p>Kim explained that erosion was eating away at the sandbank below her property, and the river was carving a new path for itself. Many people in the area had to be prepared to move their homes, or lose them for good. The river liked to keep residents on their toes.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06fsqvb\"}}</p><p>The next morning, I tossed some change into the coin-operated showers behind the Bonanza Gold Motel &amp; RV Park. A trickle of water ran across my palm and a dirt clod at the bottom of the stall dissolved into the drain. The main entrance advertised free wi-fi and hot breakfast, and the car park was jam-packed with trucks loaded with bulky metal apparatuses, their tyres caked and splattered in mud. I could tell this roadside motel served as a home-away-from-home for those who worked the nearby goldfields.</p><p>It was May and early in the summer mining season, but mountainsides had already been sliced open, exposed like open wounds, and large spots in the forest were wiped clear. Soon, the 125 mining operations that are active in the Klondike region would be humming around the clock with cranes and bulldozers digging deep into the ground.</p><p>I imagined the appeal of showing up to work in a place like this. Free from the confines of a corporate environment, my office would be in the middle of spruce forests. Every day, I could get lost staring into a sea of green instead of a computer screen.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06fsr09\"}}</p><p>I followed the winding curves of Bonanza Creek until I reached <a href=\"https://claim33.vpweb.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Claim 33</a>, a museum and local gold-panning business, where I spotted a handful of children holding plastic dishes. They were standing in front of deep troughs of water with smiles draped across their faces, preparing for their first chance at finding gold.</p><p>When I was their age, my brother and I learned to pan for gold the same way at a country-western amusement park. Our grandparents had beamed with pride when we walked away with miniature vials filled with the tiniest flakes of gold. I stored mine on a bookshelf in my bedroom, turning it every day to make sure my golden discoveries didn&rsquo;t disappear.</p><p>Across the car park, old miner cabins and vintage storefronts stood side by side, like a ghost town that had somehow been preserved. Littered throughout the yard was a collection of antique mining equipment, left behind by private prospectors from my grandfather&rsquo;s generation.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06fsqqy\"}}</p><p>I stepped inside the shop and museum, opened the guestbook and scribbled, &ldquo;To Eugene, a man who always dreamed of coming to the Klondike.&rdquo; After browsing the aisles of found objects and looking at old photographs of the region, I made my way out, but not before an employee asked me, &ldquo;Excuse me, are you Eugene?&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p> Gold runs in my blood and that was more valuable than anything I could discover at the bottom of a riverbed </p></blockquote><p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh. After spending the last two days channelling my grandfather, it was funny that the employee misunderstood my note and thought I was actually him. I explained the mix-up. No, I was not Eugene. He died almost 20 years ago, I told her. Though we shared a lot in common, like our stubborn nature and glassy blue eyes, I didn&rsquo;t have the knack for finding gold like he did. Before long, we were exchanging stories about my family&rsquo;s past and my grandfather&rsquo;s lifelong dream of seeing the Klondike. She told me about Claim 33&rsquo;s former owner, who died in 2009 as one of the region&rsquo;s last hand-panners.</p><p>&ldquo;Just like my grandfather,&rdquo; I told her. She nudged me to try panning one more time before I left, but I declined.</p><p>It was a foolish notion for me to believe that because of my family&rsquo;s history I would somehow have a magical touch. My grandfather had spent years perfecting his craft, just like the miners who uprooted their families and dedicated their lives to this profession. After being here, seeing all this, I respected his drive and passion even more.</p><p>But I wasn&rsquo;t leaving Dawson empty-handed. Gold runs in my blood, I realised, and that was more valuable than anything I could discover at the bottom of a riverbed.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06fsr3c\"}}</p><p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/columns/travel-journeys\" target=\"_blank\">Travel Journeys</a> <em>is a BBC Travel series exploring travellers&rsquo; inner journeys of transformation and growth as they experience the world.</em></p><p><em>Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCTravel/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a><em>, or follow us on&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Travel\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a><em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbc_travel/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a><em>.</em></p><p><em>If you liked this story,&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/?ocid=ear.bbc.email.we.email-signup\" target=\"_blank\">sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter</a><em>&nbsp;called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

                            <p>Not long after I moved to Kelowna, a city in southern British Columbia known for its wineries, water sports and hiking trails, I saw a news story about a monster sighting. Two brothers had seen something undulating across the water in the middle of Okanagan Lake, an 84-mile long lake that curves down the Okanagan Valley past Kelowna in the shape of a serpent. The wave crested and fanned out like a wake, but there wasn&rsquo;t a boat in sight. They were adamant it was Ogopogo.</p><blockquote><p> Ogopogo is to Kelowna what Nessie is to Loch Ness </p></blockquote><p>You can&rsquo;t live in Kelowna for any length of time without hearing about its mysterious lake creature. Ogopogo is to Kelowna what Nessie is to Loch Ness: a yet-to-be-identified cryptid that reputedly resides in the lake&rsquo;s depths and surfaces just often enough to keep the legend alive.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>It&rsquo;s been described as a multi-humped serpentine beast, with green or black skin and the head of a horse, snake or sheep. Drawings depict a coiling sea dragon like what you might see on an old mariner&rsquo;s map where it says, &ldquo;Here there be monsters.&rdquo; Around town, Ogopogo takes on a benign cartoonish form as a 15-foot-long green- and cream-coloured statue on the waterfront, the smiling mascot for the local WHL hockey team and as plush toys at souvenir shops. Like its palindrome name, its physical appearance &ndash; and very existence &ndash; is something no one can make heads nor tails of.</p><p>Ogopogo mania peaked in the 1980s when the region&rsquo;s tourism association offered a <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/clip/26627242/1986-04-27-ogopogo-myth-or-reality/" target="_blank">$1m reward</a> for proof of the creature&rsquo;s existence. Greenpeace came forward and named it an endangered species, demanding that Ogopogo be captured only on film, and not in the flesh. American TV shows of the era, including In Search Of and Unsolved Mysteries, even reported on the Okanagan Valley&rsquo;s mysterious inhabitant.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>Yet, it wasn&rsquo;t until I attended the <a href="https://indigenoustourismconference.com/" target="_blank">International Indigenous Tourism Conference</a> in Kelowna last autumn that I realised the Ogopogo of Canadian popular culture &ndash; a creature that 16% of British Columbians believe in &ndash; only came about through miscommunication between Canada&rsquo;s early European settlers and the Okanagan Valley&rsquo;s original inhabitants, the Okanagan/syilx.</p><blockquote><p> It&rsquo;s not really a monster, it&rsquo;s a spirit of the lake and it protects this valley from one end to the other </p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not really a monster, it&rsquo;s a spirit of the lake and it protects this valley from one end to the other,&rdquo; said Pat Raphael of the Westbank First Nation, a member nation of the larger Okanagan/syilx Nation Alliance, who guided me through the syilx&rsquo;s ancestral lands bordering Okanagan Lake. As our bus drove south along the water, she explained that while many in Canada know the creature as Ogopogo, to the syilx, it&rsquo;s <em>n ̓x̌ax̌aitkʷ</em> (n-ha-ha-it-koo), which means &ldquo;the sacred spirit of the lake.&rdquo; Raphael pointed out the brown hump of Rattlesnake Island across the water, where the spirit is said to dwell. She also had us practice saying n ̓x̌ax̌aitkʷ in nsyilxcən, the syilx language.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not Ogopogo! What are you, colonised?&rdquo; she joked when a few of us struggled with the pronunciation and reverted to saying Ogopogo.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>Before European fur traders arrived in the valley in 1809, the syilx had been living in the area for at least 12,000 years. They had their own laws, justice system and beliefs. Chief among them was the importance of water, represented by n ̓x̌ax̌aitkʷ. It existed in two forms: a spiritual form and a physical, tangible form, which was embodied by the lake itself. Sometimes, though, the spirit would reveal itself from within the lake.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;In our stories, [n ̓x̌ax̌aitkʷ is] actually very dark in colour and it&rsquo;s got the head of a horse and the antlers of a deer,&rdquo; said Coralee Miller, assistant manager at the new <a href="https://www.sncewips.com/" target="_blank">Sncəwips Heritage Museum</a> in West Kelowna. &ldquo;Missionaries saw our water spirit and the habit was to demonise our spiritual beliefs.&rdquo;</p><p>The syilx fed n ̓x̌ax̌aitkʷ symbolically, with tobacco and sage, and occasionally an offering of Kokanee salmon to thank the lake for providing food and water. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I think that misunderstanding came from &ndash; settlers saw us throw a little bit of meat in the water,&rdquo; Miller explained.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>Pioneers were soon telling stories of a serpent in Okanagan Lake that needed a live animal sacrifice to appease it and ensure a safe passage across the water. Once the idea of a bloodthirsty lake serpent took hold, it grew out of control &ndash; settlers began patrolling the lake with guns because they were nervous the beast would attack.</p><p>But by the 1920s (and likely in the absence of any actual human predation), cooler heads prevailed. Tourism officials named the creature Ogopogo after a catchy English folk song, whose lyrics included: &ldquo;His mother was an earwig; his father was a whale; a little bit of head; and hardly any tail; and Ogopogo was his name.&rdquo; N ̓x̌ax̌aitkʷ had transformed from a revered spirit into a cartoon-like creature that would lure tourists.</p><blockquote><p> Over time, Ogopogo is what made Kelowna a household name in Canada </p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s hard to know just how many people have travelled to Kelowna over the last century in the hope of seeing the mythical lake monster, but over time, Ogopogo is what made Kelowna a household name in Canada. For years, the creature appeared on Kelowna&rsquo;s parade float, both in town and at larger parades in the Pacific Northwest and Alberta. Gift shops hawked gimmick jars of Ogopogo&rsquo;s &ldquo;eggs&rdquo; and even its &ldquo;feces&rdquo; that would fly off shelves. While the tourism office no longer actively promotes Ogopogo today, the legend remains as popular as ever.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>Yet, the misappropriation and commodification of n ̓x̌ax̌aitkʷ is a sensitive issue. To Miller, a member of the Westbank First Nation, n ̓x̌ax̌aitkʷ and Ogopogo are two separate entities and shouldn&rsquo;t be conflated. One of the museum&rsquo;s missions is to tell the story of the area&rsquo;s Indigenous people, and talk about the importance of n ̓x̌ax̌aitkʷ in protecting the lake. It&rsquo;s part of what she calls &ldquo;de-programming;&rdquo; questioning or deconstructing the colonial perspective on local history and culture. This is also an important step towards reconciliation, an ongoing, countrywide process of establishing and maintaining respectful relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Canadians.</p><p><strong>You may also be interested in:</strong><br /> &bull; <a href="http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20200210-canadas-little-known-geological-wonder" target="_blank">Canada's little-known geological wonder</a><br /> &bull; <a href="http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20200121-the-birthplace-of-canadas-mountain-culture" target="_blank">The birthplace of Canada's mountain culture</a><br /> &bull; <a href="http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20191215-the-little-known-us-canada-border-war" target="_blank">The little-known US-Canada border war</a></p><p>This spring, Indigenous tour company <a href="https://www.moccasintrails.com/" target="_blank">Moccasin Trails</a> is launching paddling tours on Okanagan Lake where guides will discuss n ̓x̌ax̌aitkʷ as a spiritual talisman &ndash; not a physical lake monster &ndash; and explain how it became appropriated.</p><blockquote><p> We want people to leave our experiences with a better understanding of Indigenous culture </p></blockquote><p>The canoe journeys begin with a feeding of the water ceremony. As the canoe glides across the lake&rsquo;s glassy surface, a syilx cultural leader scatters sage and tobacco in the water while summoning the spirit world and telling his ancestors to keep everyone safe. Moccasin Trails co-owner Greg Hopf says the ceremony is powerful, and meant to illustrate the connection Indigenous people have with the earth, which is highly personal.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of what each person interprets the spirit to be,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We want people to leave our experiences with a better understanding of Indigenous culture.&rdquo;</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>In downtown Kelowna, the <a href="https://www.kelownamuseums.ca/museums/the-okanagan-heritage-museum/" target="_blank">Okanagan Heritage Museum</a> works with the Westbank First Nation to tell a more thorough story of the region&rsquo;s history. It redid its entire gallery in 2019 and represents syilx as a living culture, rather than focusing solely on the people&rsquo;s way of life pre-colonisation. According to Kelowna Museums&rsquo; executive director, Linda Digby, sylix knowledge and perspective is now woven into every era depicted in the museum, and a display on Ogopogo explains how n ̓x̌ax̌aitkʷ was misunderstood by settlers and grew into a tourism boon.</p><p>&ldquo;To settlers [Ogopogo] was a real thing,&rdquo; said Digby. &ldquo;They definitely misinterpreted what they heard from the Indigenous community and had no qualms about making up their own stories and appropriating from them, and it wouldn&rsquo;t have even occurred to them they were doing that.&rdquo;</p><p>As time wore on, the settlers&rsquo; inventory of stories grew &ndash; their neighbour saw the creature, or they themselves saw something strange in the lake. &ldquo;You live here long enough everyone&rsquo;s going to see something,&rdquo; Digby said.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>During my quest to understand n ̓x̌ax̌aitkʷ, I encountered a few people who are true believers based on what they&rsquo;ve seen in Okanagan Lake. And they are far from alone: the museum&rsquo;s archives are filled with newspaper clippings of Ogopogo sightings over the decades, along with stories about how a lake monster is good for the city&rsquo;s bottom line.</p><p>&ldquo;Ogopogo is great for tourism. It adds colour and panache and atmosphere,&rdquo; said Robert Young, a University of British Columbia Okanagan earth sciences professor who is often called on as a voice of reason when an Ogopogo sighting occurs or new &ldquo;footage&rdquo; surfaces.</p><p>For Young, Ogopogo isn&rsquo;t a question in biology, it&rsquo;s a question in earth science processes &ndash; the way water moves over the surface of the earth. Thermal stratification in a lake can cause a wave to appear from nowhere when a denser layer of water slides beneath a more buoyant layer, as often happens in the spring or autumn, he explained. He calls it an &ldquo;Ogopogo wave&rdquo;.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>This theory offers a plausible explanation for what people might be seeing on the water. But while Young is all for critical thinking about Ogopogo, he&rsquo;s also loathe to disprove its existence. It should persist, he says, saying that Ogopogo is a Canadian cultural icon, and n ̓x̌ax̌aitkʷ is an important part of syilx beliefs.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t worry a lake creature will nibble my toes when I go for a dip, but the power of nature gives me pause. I&rsquo;ve started many days with a morning walk that leads to a ridge ringed by mountains overlooking Okanagan Lake and the rounded hills and extinct volcanoes of the Thompson Plateau behind it. I&rsquo;m in awe I live in such a stunning place. When the wind ripples the water and sways the ponderosa pine trees growing on the hillside, I feel a connection to the natural beauty of my home. Maybe that spirit of place is my interpretation of n ̓x̌ax̌aitkʷ.</p><p><em>Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCTravel/" target="_blank">Facebook</a><em>, or follow us on&nbsp;</em><a href="https://twitter.com/BBC_Travel" target="_blank">Twitter</a><em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbc_travel/" target="_blank">Instagram</a><em>.</em></p><p><em>If you liked this story,&nbsp;</em><a href="http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/?ocid=ear.bbc.email.we.email-signup" target="_blank">sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter</a><em>&nbsp;called "The Essential List".
